that do excelTheir equals in historiology\\nSpeak not of Mansoul\\'s wars\\n but let them lieDead\\n like old fables\\n or such worthless things\\nThat to the reader no advantage brings\\nWhen men\\n let them make what they will their own\\nTill they know this\\n are to themselves unknown\\nOf stories\\n I well know\\n there\\'s divers sorts\\nSome foreign\\n some domestic\\n and reportsAre thereof made as fancy leads the writers\\n(By books a man may guess at the inditers\\n)Some will again of that which never was\\nNor will be\\n feign (and that without a cause)Such matter\\n raise such mountains\\n tell such thingsOf men\\n of laws\\n of countries\\n and of kings\\nAnd in their story seem to be so sage\\nAnd with such gravity clothe every page\\nThat though their frontispiece says all is vain\\nYet to their way disciples they obtain\\nBut\\n readers\\n I have somewhat else to do\\nThan with vain stories thus to trouble you\\nWhat here I say\\n some men do know so well\\nThey can with tears and joy the story tell\\nThe town of Mansoul is well known to many\\nNor are her troubles doubted of by anyThat are acquainted with those HistoriesThat Mansoul and her wars anatomize\\nThen lend thine ear to what I do relate\\nTouching the town of Mansoul and her state\\nHow she was lost\\n took captive\\n made a slave\\nAnd how against him set\\n that should her save\\nYea\\n how by hostile ways she did opposeHer Lord\\n and with his enemy did close\\nFor they are true\\n he that will them denyMust needs the best of records vilify\\nFor my part\\n I myself was in the town\\nBoth when \\'twas set up\\n and when pulling down\\nI saw Diabolus in his possession\\nAnd Mansoul also under his oppression\\nYea\\n I was there when she own\\'d him for lord\\nAnd to him did submit with one accord\\nWhen Mansoul trampled upon things divine\\nAnd wallowed in filth as doth a swine\\nWhen she betook herself unto her arms\\nFought her Emmanuel\\n despis\\'d his charms\\nThen I was there\\n and did rejoice to seeDiabolus and Mansoul so agree\\nLet no men\\n then\\n count me a fable-maker\\nNor make my name or credit a partakerOf their derision\\n what is here in view\\nOf mine own knowledge\\n I dare say is true\\nI saw the Prince\\'s armed men come downBy troops\\n by thousands\\n to besiege the town\\nI saw the captains\\n heard the trumpets sound\\nAnd how his forces covered all the ground\\nYea\\n how they set themselves in battle-\\'ray\\nI shall remember to my dying day\\nI saw the colours waving in the wind\\nAnd they within to mischief how combin\\'dTo ruin Mansoul\\n and to make awayHer primum mobile without delay\\nI saw the mounts cast up against the town\\nAnd how the slings were placed to beat it down\\nI heard the stones fly whizzing by mine ears\\n(What longer kept in mind than got in fears\\n)I heard them fall\\n and saw what work they made\\nAnd how old Mors did cover with his shadeThe face of Mansoul\\n and I heard her cry\\n\\'Woe worth the day\\n in dying I shall die\\n\\'I saw the battering-rams\\n and how they play\\'dTo beat open Ear-gate\\n and I was afraidNot only Ear-gate\\n but the very townWould by those battering-rams be beaten down\\nI saw the fights\\n and heard the captains shout\\nAnd in each battle saw who faced about\\nI saw who wounded were\\n and who were slain\\nAnd who\\n when dead\\n would come to life again\\nI heard the cries of those that wounded were\\n(While others fought like men bereft of fear\\n)And while the cry\\n \\'Kill\\n kill\\n\\' was in mine ears\\nThe gutters ran\\n not so with blood as tears\\nIndeed\\n the captains did not always fight\\nBut then they would molest us day and night\\nTheir cry\\n \\'Up\\n fall on\\n let us take the town\\n\\'Kept us from sleeping\\n or from lying down\\nI was there when the gates were broken ope\\nAnd saw how Mansoul then was stripp\\'d of hope\\nI saw the captains march into the town\\nHow there they fought\\n and did their foes cut down\\nI heard the Prince bid Boanerges goUp to the castle\\n and there seize his foe\\nAnd saw him and his fellows bring him down\\nIn chains of great contempt quite through the town\\nI saw Emmanuel\\n when he possess\\'dHis town of Mansoul\\n and how greatly blestA town his gallant town of Mansoul was\\nWhen she received his pardon\\n loved his laws\\nWhen the Diabolonians were caught\\nWhen tried\\n and when to execution brought\\nThen I was there\\n yea\\n I was standing byWhen Mansoul did the rebels crucify\\nI also saw Mansoul clad all in white\\nI heard her Prince call her his heart\\'s delight\\nI saw him put upon her chains of gold\\nAnd rings\\n and bracelets\\n goodly to behold\\nWhat shall I say\\n  I heard the people\\'s cries\\nAnd saw the Prince wipe tears from Mansoul\\'s eyes\\nAnd heard the groans\\n and saw the joy of many\\nTell you of all\\n I neither will\\n nor can I\\nBut by what here I say\\n you well may seeThat Mansoul\\'s matchless wars no fables be\\nMansoul\\n the desire of both princes was\\nOne keep his gain would\\n t\\'other gain his loss\\nDiabolus would cry\\n \\'The town is mine\\n\\'Emmanuel would plead a right divineUnto his Mansoul\\n then to blows they go\\nAnd Mansoul cries\\n \\'These wars will me undo\\n\\'Mansoul\\n her wars seemed endless in her eyes\\nShe\\'s lost by one\\n becomes another\\'s prize\\nAnd he again that lost her last would swear\\n\\'Have her I will\\n or her in pieces tear\\n\\'Mansoul\\n it was the very seat of war\\nWherefore her troubles greater were by farThan only where the noise of war is heard\\nOr where the shaking of a sword is fear\\'d\\nOr only where small skirmishes are fought\\nOr where the fancy fighteth with a thought\\nShe saw the swords of fighting men made red\\nAnd heard the cries of those with them wounded\\nMust not her frights\\n then\\n be much more by farThan theirs that to such doings strangers are\\nOr theirs that hear the beating of a drum\\nBut not made fly for fear from house and home\\nMansoul not only heard the trumpet\\'s sound\\nBut saw her gallants gasping on the ground\\nWherefore we must not think that she could restWith them\\n whose greatest earnest is but jest\\nOr where the blust\\'ring threat\\'ning of great warsDo end in parlies\\n or in wording jars\\nMansoul\\n her mighty wars\\n they did portendHer weal or woe\\n and that world without end\\nWherefore she must be more concern\\'d than theyWhose fears begin\\n and end the selfsame day\\nOr where none other harm doth come to himThat is engaged\\n but loss of life or limb\\nAs all must needs confess that now do dwellIn Universe\\n and can this story tell\\nCount me not\\n then\\n with them that\\n to amazeThe people\\n set them on the stars to gaze\\nInsinuating with much confidence\\nThat each of them is now the residenceOf some brave creatures\\n yea\\n a world they willHave in each star\\n though it be past their skillTo make it manifest to any man\\nThat reason hath\\n or tell his fingers can\\nBut I have too long held thee in the porch\\nAnd kept thee from the sunshine with a torch\\nWell\\n now go forward\\n step within the door\\nAnd there behold five hundred times much moreOf all sorts of such inward raritiesAs please the mind will\\n and will feed the eyesWith those\\n which\\n if a Christian\\n thou wilt seeNot small\\n but things of greatest moment be\\nNor do thou go to work without my key\\n(In mysteries men soon do lose their way\\n)And also turn it right\\n if thou wouldst knowMy riddle\\n and wouldst

RELATION OF THE HOLY WAR\\nIN my travels\\n as I walked through many regions andcountries\\n it was my chance to happen into that famouscontinent of Universe\\n  A very large and spacious country itis\\n it lieth between the two poles\\n and just amidst the fourpoints of the heavens\\n  It is a place well watered\\n andrichly adorned with hills and valleys\\n bravely situate\\n andfor the most part\\n at least where I was\\n very fruitful\\n alsowell peopled\\n and a very sweet air\\nThe people are not all of one complexion\\n nor yet of onelanguage\\n mode\\n or way of religion\\n but differ as much as\\n itis said\\n do the planets themselves\\n  Some are right\\n and someare wrong\\n even as it happeneth to be in lesser regions\\nIn this country\\n as I said\\n it was my lot to travel\\n andthere travel I did\\n and that so long\\n even till I learnedmuch of their mother tongue\\n together with the customs andmanners of them among whom I was\\n  And\\n to speak truth\\n I wasmuch delighted to see and hear many things which I saw andheard among them\\n yea\\n I had\\n to be sure\\n even lived and dieda native among them\\n (so was I taken with them and theirdoings\\n) had not my master sent for me home to his house\\nthere to do business for him\\n and to oversee business done\\nNow there is in this gallant country of Universe a fair anddelicate town\\n a corporation called Mansoul\\n a town for itsbuilding so curious\\n for its situation so commodious\\n for itsprivileges so advantageous\\n (I mean with reference to itsorigin\\n) that I may say of it\\n as was said before of thecontinent in which it is placed\\n There is not its equal underthe whole heaven\\nAs to the situation of this town\\n it lieth just between thetwo worlds\\n and the first founder and builder of it\\n so faras by the best and most authentic records I can gather\\n wasone Shaddai\\n and he built it for his own delight\\n  He made itthe mirror and glory of all that he made\\n even the top-piece\\nbeyond anything else that he did in that country\\n  Yea\\n sogoodly a town was Mansoul when first built\\n that it is saidby some\\n the gods\\n at the setting up thereof\\n came down tosee it\\n and sang for joy\\n  And as he made it goodly tobehold\\n so also mighty to have dominion over all the countryround about\\n  Yea\\n all were commanded to acknowledge Mansoulfor their metropolitan\\n all were enjoined to do homage to it\\nAye\\n the town itself had positive commission and power fromher King to demand service of all\\n and also to subdue anythat anyways denied to do it\\nThere was reared up in the midst of this town a most famousand stately palace\\n for strength\\n it might be called acastle\\n for pleasantness\\n a paradise\\n for largeness\\n a placeso copious as to contain all the world\\n  This place the KingShaddai intended but for himself alone\\n and not another withhim\\n partly because of his own delights\\n and partly becausehe would not that the terror of strangers should be upon thetown\\n  This place Shaddai made also a garrison of\\n butcommitted the keeping of it only to the men of the town\\nThe walls of the town were well built\\n yea\\n so fast and firmwere they knit and compact together\\n that\\n had it not beenfor the townsmen themselves\\n they could not have been shakenor broken for ever\\n  For here lay the excellent wisdom of himthat builded Mansoul\\n that the walls could never be brokendown nor hurt by the most mighty adverse potentate\\n unlessthe townsmen gave consent thereto\\nThis famous town of Mansoul had five gates\\n in at which tocome\\n out at which to go\\n and these were made likewiseanswerable to the walls\\n to wit\\n impregnable\\n and such ascould never be opened nor forced but by the will and leave ofthose within\\n  The names of the gates were these\\n Ear-gate\\nEye-gate\\n Mouth-gate\\n Nose-gate\\n and Feel-gate\\nOther things there were that belonged to the town of Mansoul\\nwhich if you adjoin to these\\n will yet give fartherdemonstration to all\\n of the glory and strength of the place\\nIt had always a sufficiency of provision within its walls\\n ithad the best\\n most wholesome\\n and excellent law that then wasextant in the world\\n  There was not a rascal\\n rogue\\n ortraitorous person then within its walls\\n they were all truemen\\n and fast joined together\\n and this\\n you know\\n is a greatmatter\\n  And to all these\\n it had always (so long as it hadthe goodness to keep true to Shaddai the King) hiscountenance\\n his protection\\n and it was his delight\\n etc\\nWell\\n upon a time\\n there was one Diabolus\\n a mighty giant\\nmade an assault upon this famous town of Mansoul\\n to take it\\nand make it his own habitation\\n  This giant was king of theblacks\\n and a most raving prince he was\\n  We will\\n if youplease\\n first discourse of the origin of this Diabolus\\n andthen of his taking of this famous town of Mansoul\\nThis Diabolus is indeed a great and mighty prince\\n and yetboth poor and beggarly\\n  As to his origin\\n he was at firstone of the servants of King Shaddai\\n made\\n and taken\\n and putby him into most high and mighty place\\n yea\\n was put intosuch principalities as belonged to the best of histerritories and dominions\\n  This Diabolus was made \\'son ofthe morning\\n\\' and a brave place he had of it\\n it brought himmuch glory\\n and gave him much brightness\\n an income thatmight have contented his Luciferian heart\\n had it not beeninsatiable\\n and enlarged as hell itself\\nWell\\n he seeing himself thus exalted to greatness and honour\\nand raging in his mind for higher state and degree\\n what dothhe but begins to think with himself how he might be set up aslord over all\\n and have the sole power under Shaddai\\n  (Nowthat did the King reserve for his Son\\n yea\\n and had alreadybestowed it upon him\\n)  Wherefore he first consults withhimself what had best to be done\\n and then breaks his mind tosome other of his companions\\n to the which they also agreed\\nSo\\n in fine\\n they came to this issue that they should make anattempt upon the King\\'s Son to destroy him\\n that theinheritance might be theirs\\n  Well\\n to be short\\n the treason\\nas I said\\n was concluded\\n the time appointed\\n the word given\\nthe rebels rendezvoused\\n and the assault attempted\\n  Now theKing and his Son being all and always eye\\n could not butdiscern all passages in his dominions\\n and he\\n having alwayslove for his Son as for himself\\n could not at what he saw butbe greatly provoked and offended\\n wherefore what does he\\n buttakes them in the very nick and first trip that they madetowards their design\\n convicts them of the treason\\n horridrebellion\\n and conspiracy that they had devised\\n and nowattempted to put into practice\\n and casts them altogether outof all place of trust\\n benefit\\n honour\\n and preferment\\n  Thisdone\\n he banishes them the court\\n turns them down into thehorrible pits\\n as fast bound in chains\\n never more to expectthe least favour from his hands\\n but to abide the judgmentthat he had appointed\\n and that for ever\\nNow they being thus cast out of all place of trust\\n profit\\nand honour\\n and also knowing that they had lost theirprince\\'s favour for ever\\n (being banished his court\\n and castdown to the horrible pits\\n) you may he sure they would nowadd to their former pride what malice and rage againstShaddai\\n and against his Son\\n they could\\n  Wherefore\\n rovingand ranging in much fury from place to place\\n if\\n perhaps\\nthey might find something that was the King\\'s\\n by spoiling ofthat\\n to revenge themselves on him\\n at last they happenedinto this spacious country of Universe\\n and steer theircourse towards the town of Mansoul\\n and considering that thattown was one of the chief works and delights of King Shaddai\\nwhat do they but\\n after counsel taken\\n make an assault uponthat\\n  I say\\n they knew that Mansoul belonged unto Shaddai\\nfor they were there when he built it and beautified it forhimself\\n  So when they had found the place\\n they shoutedhorribly for joy\\n and roared on it as a lion upon the prey\\nsaying\\n \\'Now we have found the prize\\n and how to be revengedon King Shaddai for what he hath done to us\\n\\'  So they satdown and called a council of war\\n and considered withthemselves what ways and methods they had best to engage infor the winning to themselves this famous town of Mansoul\\nand these four things were then propounded to be consideredof\\nFirst\\n  Whether they had best all of them to show themselvesin this design to the town of Mansoul\\nSecondly\\n  Whether they had best to go and sit down againstMansoul in their now ragged and beggarly guise\\nThirdly\\n  Whether they had best show to Mansoul theirintentions\\n and what design they came about\\n or whether toassault it with words and ways of deceit\\nFourthly\\n  Whether they had not best to some of theircompanions to give out private orders to take the advantage\\nif they see one or more of the principal townsmen\\n to shootthem\\n if thereby they shall judge their cause and design willthe better be promoted\\n1\\n It was answered to the first of these proposals in thenegative\\n to wit\\n that it would not be best that all shouldshow themselves before the town\\n because the appearance ofmany of them might alarm and frighten the town\\n whereas a fewor but one of them was not so likely to do it\\n  And toenforce this advice to take place it was added further\\n thatif Mansoul was frighted\\n or did take the alarm\\n \\'It isimpossible\\n\\' said Diabolus (for he spake now)\\n \\'that weshould take the town\\n for that none can enter into it withoutits own consent\\n  Let\\n therefore\\n but few\\n or but one\\nassault Mansoul\\n and in mine opinion\\n\\' said Diabolus\\n \\'let mebe he\\n\\'  Wherefore to this they all agreed\\n2\\n And then to the second proposal they came\\n namely\\n Whetherthey had best go and sit down before Mansoul in their nowragged and beggarly guise\\n  To which it was answered also inthe negative\\n By no means\\n and that because\\n though the townof Mansoul had been made to know\\n and to have to do\\n beforenow\\n with things that are invisible\\n they did never as yetsee any of their fellow-creatures in so sad and rascallycondition as they\\n and this was the advice of that fierceAlecto\\n  Then said Apollyon\\n \\'The advice is pertinent\\n foreven one of us appearing to them as we are now\\n must needsboth beget and multiply such thoughts in them as will bothput them into a consternation of spirit\\n and necessitate themto put themselves upon their guard\\n  And if so\\n\\' said he\\n\\'then\\n as my Lord Diabolus said but now\\n it is in vain for usto think of taking the town\\n\\'  Then said that mighty giantBeelzebub\\n \\'The advice that already is given is safe\\n forthough the men of Mansoul have seen such things as we oncewere\\n yet hitherto they did never behold such things as wenow are\\n and it is best\\n in mine opinion\\n to come upon themin such a guise as is common to\\n and most familiar amongthem\\n\\'  To this\\n when they had consented\\n the next thing tobe considered was\\n in what shape\\n hue\\n or guise Diabolus hadbest to show himself when he went about to make Mansoul hisown\\n  Then one said one thing\\n and another the contrary\\n  Atlast Lucifer answered\\n that\\n in his opinion\\n it was best thathis lordship should assume the body of some of thosecreatures that they of the town had dominion over\\n \\'for\\n\\'quoth he\\n \\'these are not only familiar to them\\n but\\n beingunder them\\n they will never imagine that an attempt should bythem be made upon the town\\n and\\n to blind all\\n let him assumethe body of one of those beasts that Mansoul deems to bewiser than any of the rest\\n\\'  This advice was applauded ofall\\n so it was determined that the giant Diabolus shouldassume the dragon\\n for that he was in those days as familiarwith the town of Mansoul as now is the bird with the boy\\n fornothing that was in its primitive state was at all amazing tothem\\n  Then they proceeded to the third thing\\n which was\\n3\\n Whether they had best to show their intentions\\n or thedesign of his coming\\n to Mansoul\\n or no\\n  This also wasanswered in the negative\\n because of the weight that was inthe former reasons\\n to wit\\n for that Mansoul were a strongpeople\\n a strong people in a strong town\\n whose wall andgates were impregnable\\n (to say nothing of their castle\\n) norcan they by any means be won but by their own consent\\n\\'Besides\\n\\' said Legion\\n (for he gave answer to this\\n) \\'adiscovery of our intentions may make them send to their kingfor aid\\n and if that be done\\n I know quickly what time of dayit will be with us\\n  Therefore let us assault them in allpretended fairness\\n covering our intentions with all mannerof lies\\n flatteries\\n delusive words\\n feigning things thatnever will be\\n and promising that to them that they shallnever find\\n  This is the way to win Mansoul\\n and to make themof themselves open their gates to us\\n yea\\n and to desire ustoo to come in to them\\n  And the reason why I think that thisproject will do is\\n because the people of Mansoul now are\\nevery one\\n simple and innocent\\n all honest and true\\n nor dothey as yet know what it is to be assaulted with fraud\\nguile\\n and hypocrisy\\n  They are strangers to lying anddissembling lips\\n wherefore we cannot\\n if thus we bedisguised\\n by them at all be discerned\\n our lies shall go fortrue sayings\\n and our dissimulations for upright dealings\\nWhat we promise them they will in that believe us\\n especiallyif\\n in all our lies and feigned words\\n we pretend great loveto them\\n and that our design is only their advantage andhonour\\n\\'  Now there was not one bit of a reply against this\\nthis went as current down as doth the water down a steepdescent\\n  Wherefore they go to consider of the last proposal\\nwhich was\\n4\\n Whether they had not best to give out orders to some oftheir company to shoot some one or more of the principal ofthe townsmen\\n if they judge that their cause may be promotedthereby\\n  This was carried in the affirmative\\n and the manthat was designed by this stratagem to be destroyed was oneMr\\n Resistance\\n otherwise called Captain Resistance\\n  And agreat man in Mansoul this Captain Resistance was\\n and a manthat the giant Diabolus and his band more feared than theyfeared the whole town of Mansoul besides\\n  Now who should bethe actor to do the murder\\n  That was the next\\n and theyappointed one Tisiphone\\n a fury of the lake\\n to do it\\nThey thus having ended their council of war\\n rose up\\n andessayed to do as they had determined\\n they marched towardsMansoul\\n but all in a manner invisible\\n save one\\n only one\\nnor did he approach the town in his own likeness\\n but underthe shade and in the body of the dragon\\nSo they drew up and sat down before Ear-gate\\n for that wasthe place of hearing for all without the town\\n as Eye-gatewas the place of perspection\\n  So\\n as I said\\n he came up withhis train to the gate\\n and laid his ambuscado for CaptainResistance within bow-shot of the town\\n  This done\\n the giantascended up close to the gate\\n and called to the town ofMansoul for audience\\n  Nor took he any with him but one Ill-pause\\n who was his orator in all difficult matters\\n  Now\\n asI said\\n he being come up to the gate\\n (as the manner of thosetimes was\\n) sounded his trumpet for audience\\n at which thechief of the town of Mansoul\\n such as my Lord Innocent\\n myLord Willbewill\\n my Lord Mayor\\n Mr\\n Recorder\\n and CaptainResistance\\n came down to the wall to see who was there\\n andwhat was the matter\\n  And my Lord Willbewill\\n when he hadlooked over and saw who stood at the gate\\n demanded what hewas\\n wherefore he was come\\n and why he roused the town ofMansoul with so unusual a sound\\nDiabolus\\n then\\n as if he had been a lamb\\n began his oration\\nand said\\n \\'Gentlemen of the famous town of Mansoul\\n I am\\n asyou may perceive\\n no far dweller from you\\n but near\\n and onethat is bound by the king to do you my homage and whatservice I can\\n wherefore\\n that I may be faithful to myselfand to you\\n I have somewhat of concern to impart unto you\\nWherefore\\n grant me your audience\\n and hear me patiently\\nAnd first\\n I will assure you\\n it is not myself\\n but you - notmine\\n but your advantage that I seek by what I now do\\n aswill full well be made manifest\\n by that I have opened mymind unto you\\n  For\\n gentlemen\\n I am (to tell you the truth)come to show you how you may obtain great and ampledeliverance from a bondage that\\n unawares to yourselves\\n youare captivated and enslaved under\\n\\'  At this the town ofMansoul began to prick up its ears\\n  And \\'What is it\\n  Praywhat is it\\n\\' thought they\\n  And he said\\n \\'I have somewhat tosay to you concerning your King\\n concerning his law\\n and alsotouching yourselves\\n  Touching your King\\n I know he is greatand potent\\n but yet all that he hath said to you is neithertrue nor yet for your advantage\\n  1\\n It is not true\\n for thatwherewith he hath hitherto awed you\\n shall not come to pass\\nnor be fulfilled\\n though you do the thing that he hathforbidden\\n  But if there was danger\\n what a slavery is it tolive always in fear of the greatest of punishments\\n for doingso small and trivial a thing as eating of a little fruit is\\n2\\n Touching his laws\\n this I say further\\n they are bothunreasonable\\n intricate\\n and intolerable\\n  Unreasonable\\n aswas hinted before\\n for that the punishment is notproportioned to the offence\\n there is great difference anddisproportion between the life and an apple\\n yet the one mustgo for the other by the law of your Shaddai\\n  But it is alsointricate\\n in that he saith\\n first\\n you may eat of all\\n andyet after forbids the eating of one\\n  And then\\n in the lastplace\\n it must needs be intolerable\\n forasmuch as that fruitwhich you are forbidden to eat of (if you are forbidden any)is that\\n and that alone\\n which is able\\n by your eating\\n tominister to you a good as yet unknown by you\\n  This ismanifest by the very name of the tree\\n it is called the \"treeof knowledge of good and evil\\n\" and have you that knowledgeas yet\\n No\\n no\\n nor can you conceive how good\\n how pleasant\\nand how much to be desired to make one wise it is\\n so long asyou stand by your King\\'s commandment\\n  Why should you beholden in ignorance and blindness\\n  Why should you not beenlarged in knowledge and understanding\\n  And now\\n O yeinhabitants of the famous town of Mansoul\\n to speak moreparticularly to yourselves you are not a free people\\n  Youare kept both in bondage and slavery\\n and that by a grievousthreat\\n no reason being annexed but\\n \"So I will have it\\n soit shall be\\n\"  And is it not grievous to think on\\n that thatvery thing which you are forbidden to do might you but do it\\nwould yield you both wisdom and honour\\n for then your eyeswill be opened\\n and you shall be as gods\\n  Now\\n since this isthus\\n\\' quoth he\\n \\'can you be kept by any prince in moreslavery and in greater bondage than you are under this day\\nYou are made underlings\\n and are wrapped up ininconveniences\\n as I have well made appear\\n  For what bondagegreater than to be kept in blindness\\n  Will not reason tellyou that it is better to have eyes than to be without them\\nand so to be at liberty to be better than to be shut up in adark and stinking cave\\n\\'And just now\\n while Diabolus was speaking these words toMansoul\\n Tisiphone shot at Captain Resistance\\n where he stoodon the gate\\n and mortally wounded him in the head\\n so thathe\\n to the amazement of the townsmen\\n and the encouragementof Diabolus\\n fell down dead quite over the wall\\n  Now\\n whenCaptain Resistance was dead\\n (and he was the only man of warin the town\\n) poor Mansoul was wholly left naked of courage\\nnor had she now any heart to resist\\n  But this was as thedevil would have it\\n  Then stood forth he\\n Mr\\n Ill-pause\\nthat Diabolus brought with him\\n who was his orator\\n and headdressed himself to speak to the town of Mansoul\\n the tenourof whose speech here follows\\n-\\'Gentlemen\\n\\' quoth he\\n \\'it is my master\\'s happiness that hehas this day a quiet and teachable auditory\\n and it is hopedby us that we shall prevail with you not to cast off goodadvice\\n  My master has a very great love for you\\n andalthough\\n as he very well knows\\n that he runs the hazard ofthe anger of King Shaddai\\n yet love to you will make him domore than that\\n  Nor doth there need that a word more shouldbe spoken to confirm for truth what he hath said\\n there isnot a word but carries with it self-evidence in its bowels\\nthe very name of the tree may put an end to all controversyin this matter\\n  I therefore\\n at this time\\n shall only addthis advice to you\\n under and by the leave of my lord\\n\\' (andwith that he made Diabolus a very low congee\\n) \\'consider hiswords\\n look on the tree and the promising fruit thereof\\nremember also that yet you know but little\\n and that this isthe way to know more\\n and if your reasons be not conquered toaccept of such good counsel\\n you are not the men that I tookyou to be\\n\\'But when the townsfolk saw that the tree was good for food\\nand that it was pleasant to the eye\\n and a tree to be desiredto make one wise\\n they did as old Ill-pause advised\\n theytook and did eat thereof\\n  Now this I should have told youbefore\\n that even then\\n when this Ill-pause was making hisspeech to the townsmen\\n my Lord Innocency (whether by a shotfrom the camp of the giant\\n or from some sinking qualm thatsuddenly took him\\n or whether by the stinking breath of thattreacherous villain old Ill-pause\\n for so I am most apt tothink) sunk down in the place where he stood\\n nor could bebrought to life again\\n  Thus these two brave men died - bravemen\\n I call them\\n for they were the beauty and glory ofMansoul\\n so long as they lived therein\\n nor did there nowremain any more a noble spirit in Mansoul\\n they all fell downand yielded obedience to Diabolus\\n and became his slaves andvassals\\n as you shall hear\\nNow these being dead\\n what do the rest of the townsfolk\\n but\\nas men that had found a fool\\'s paradise\\n they presently\\n asafore was hinted\\n fall to prove the truth of the giant\\'swords\\n  And\\n first\\n they did as Ill-pause had taught them\\nthey looked\\n they considered they were taken with theforbidden fruit\\n they took thereof\\n and did eat\\n and havingeaten\\n they became immediately drunken therewith\\n  So theyopen the gate\\n both Ear-gate and Eye-gate\\n and let inDiabolus with all his bands\\n quite forgetting their goodShaddai\\n his law\\n and the judgment that he had annexed\\n withsolemn threatening\\n to the breach thereof\\n Diabolus\\n having now obtained entrance in at the gates ofthe town\\n marches up to the middle thereof\\n to make hisconquest as sure as he could\\n and finding\\n by this time\\n theaffections of the people warmly inclining to him\\n he\\n asthinking it was best striking while the iron is hot\\n madethis further deceivable speech unto them\\n saying\\n \\'Alas\\n mypoor Mansoul\\n  I have done thee indeed this service\\n as topromote thee to honour\\n and to greaten thy liberty\\n but\\nalas\\n alas\\n poor Mansoul\\n thou wantest now one to defendthee\\n for assure thyself that when Shaddai shall hear what isdone\\n he will come\\n for sorry will he be that thou hastbroken his bonds\\n and cast his cords away from thee\\n  Whatwilt thou do\\n  Wilt thou\\n after enlargement\\n suffer thyprivileges to be invaded and taken away\\n or what wilt resolvewith thyself\\n\\'Then they all with one consent said to this bramble\\n \\'Do thoureign over us\\n\\'  So he accepted the motion\\n and became theking of the town of Mansoul\\n  This being done\\n the next thingwas to give him possession of the castle\\n and so of the wholestrength of the town\\n  Wherefore\\n into the castle he goes\\n itwas that which Shaddai built in Mansoul for his own delightand pleasure\\n this now was become a den and hold for thegiant Diabolus\\nNow\\n having got possession of this stately palace or castle\\nwhat doth he but makes it a garrison for himself\\n andstrengthens and fortifies it with all sorts of provision\\nagainst the King Shaddai\\n or those that should endeavour theregaining of it to him and his obedience again\\nThis done\\n but not thinking himself yet secure enough\\n in thenext place he bethinks himself of new modelling the town\\n andso he does\\n setting up one\\n and putting down another atpleasure\\n  Wherefore my Lord Mayor\\n whose name was my LordUnderstanding\\n and Mr\\n Recorder\\n whose name was Mr\\nConscience\\n these he put out of place and power\\nAs for my Lord Mayor\\n though he was an understanding man\\n andone too that had complied with the rest of the town ofMansoul in admitting the giant into the town\\n yet Diabolusthought not fit to let him abide in his former lustre andglory\\n because he was a seeing man\\n  Wherefore he darkenedhim\\n not only by taking from him his office and power\\n but bybuilding a high and strong tower\\n just between the sun\\'sreflections and the windows of my lord\\'s palace\\n by whichmeans his house and all\\n and the whole of his habitation\\nwere made as dark as darkness itself\\n  And thus\\n beingalienated from the light\\n he became as one that was bornblind\\n  To this\\n his house\\n my lord was confined as to aprison\\n nor might he\\n upon his parole\\n go farther than withinhis own bounds\\n  And now\\n had he had a heart to do forMansoul\\n what could he do for it\\n or wherein could he beprofitable to her\\n  So then\\n so long as Mansoul was under thepower and government of Diabolus\\n (and so long it was underhim\\n as it was obedient to him\\n which was even until by a warit was rescued out of his hand\\n) so long my Lord Mayor wasrather an impediment in\\n than an advantage to the famous townof Mansoul\\nAs for Mr\\n Recorder\\n before the town was taken\\n he was a manwell read in the laws of his king\\n and also a man of courageand faithfulness to speak truth at every occasion\\n and he hada tongue as bravely hung as he had a head filled withjudgment\\n  Now\\n this man Diabolus could by no means abide\\nbecause\\n though he gave his consent to his coming into thetown\\n yet he could not\\n by all the wiles\\n trials\\n stratagems\\nand devices that he could use\\n make him wholly his own\\nTrue\\n he was much degenerated from his former king\\n and alsomuch pleased with many of the giant\\'s laws and service\\n butall this would not do\\n forasmuch as he was not wholly his\\nHe would now and then think upon Shaddai\\n and have dread ofhis law upon him\\n and then he would speak against Diaboluswith a voice as great as when a lion roareth\\n  Yea\\n and wouldalso at certain times\\n when his fits were upon him\\n (for youmust know that sometimes he had terrible fits\\n) make thewhole town of Mansoul shake with his voice\\n and therefore thenow king of Mansoul could not abide him\\nDiabolus\\n therefore\\n feared the Recorder more than any thatwas left alive in the town of Mansoul\\n because\\n as I said\\nhis words did shake the whole town\\n they were like therattling thunder\\n and also like thunder-claps\\n  Since\\ntherefore\\n the giant could not make him wholly his own\\n whatdoth he do but studies all that he could to debauch the oldgentleman\\n and by debauchery to stupefy his mind\\n and moreharden his heart in the ways of vanity\\n  And as he attempted\\nso he accomplished his design\\n he debauched the man\\n and bylittle and little so drew him into sin and wickedness\\n thatat last he was not only debauched\\n as at first\\n and so byconsequence defiled\\n but was almost (at last\\n I say) past allconscience of sin\\n  And this was the farthest Diabolus couldgo\\n  Wherefore he bethinks him of another project\\n and thatwas\\n to persuade the men of the town that Mr\\n Recorder wasmad\\n and so not to be regarded\\n  And for this he urged hisfits\\n and said\\n \\'If he be himself\\n why doth he not do thusalways\\n  But\\n\\' quoth he\\n \\'as all mad folks have their fits\\nand in them their raving language\\n so hath this old anddoating gentleman\\n\\'Thus\\n by one means or another\\n he quickly got Mansoul toslight\\n neglect\\n and despise whatever Mr\\n Recorder could say\\nFor\\n besides what already you have heard\\n Diabolus had a wayto make the old gentleman\\n when he was merry\\n unsay and denywhat he in his fits had affirmed\\n  And\\n indeed\\n this was thenext way to make himself ridiculous\\n and to cause that no manshould regard him\\n  Also now he never spake freely for KingShaddai\\n but also by force and constraint\\n  Besides\\n he wouldat one time be hot against that at which\\n at another\\n hewould hold his peace\\n so uneven was he now in his doings\\nSometimes he would be as if fast asleep\\n and again sometimesas dead\\n even then when the whole town of Mansoul was in hercareer after vanity\\n and in her dance after the giant\\'s pipe\\nWherefore\\n sometimes when Mansoul did use to be frighted withthe thundering voice of the Recorder that was\\n and when theydid tell Diabolus of it\\n he would answer\\n that what the oldgentleman said was neither of love to him nor pity to them\\nbut of a foolish fondness that he had to be prating\\n and sowould hush\\n still\\n and put all to quiet again\\n  And that hemight leave no argument unurged that might tend to make themsecure\\n he said\\n and said it often\\n \\'O Mansoul\\n considerthat\\n notwithstanding the old gentleman\\'s rage\\n and therattle of his high and thundering words\\n you hear nothing ofShaddai himself\\n\\' when\\n liar and deceiver that he was\\n everyoutcry of Mr\\n Recorder against the sin of Mansoul was thevoice of God in him to them\\n  But he goes on\\n and says\\n \\'Yousee that he values not the loss nor rebellion of the town ofMansoul\\n nor will he trouble himself with calling his town toa reckoning for their giving themselves to me\\n  He knows thatthough you were his\\n now you are lawfully mine\\n so\\n leavingus one to another\\n he now hath shaken his hands of us\\n\\'Moreover\\n O Mansoul\\n\\' quoth he\\n \\'consider how I have servedyou\\n even to the uttermost of my power\\n and that with thebest that I have\\n could get\\n or procure for you in all theworld\\n besides\\n I dare say that the laws and customs that younow are under\\n and by which you do homage to me\\n do yield youmore solace and content than did the paradise that at firstyou possessed\\n  Your liberty also\\n as yourselves do very wellknow\\n has been greatly widened and enlarged by me\\n whereas Ifound you a penned-up people\\n  I have not laid any restraintupon you\\n you have no law\\n statute\\n or judgment of mine tofright you\\n I call none of you to account for your doings\\nexcept the madman - you know who I mean\\n I have granted youto live\\n each man like a prince in his own\\n even with aslittle control from me as I myself have from you\\n\\'And thus would Diabolus hush up and quiet the town ofMansoul\\n when the Recorder that was\\n did at times molestthem\\n yea\\n and with such cursed orations as these\\n would setthe whole town in a rage and fury against the old gentleman\\nYea\\n the rascal crew at some times would be for destroyinghim\\n  They have often wished\\n in my hearing\\n that he hadlived a thousand miles off from them\\n his company\\n his words\\nyea\\n the sight of him\\n and specially when they remembered howin old times he did use to threaten and condemn them\\n (forall he was now so debauched\\n) did terrify and afflict themsore\\nBut all wishes were vain\\n for I do not know how\\n unless bythe power of Shaddai\\n and his wisdom\\n he was preserved inbeing amongst them\\n  Besides\\n his house was as strong as acastle\\n and stood hard by a stronghold of the town\\n moreover\\nif at any time any of the crew or rabble attempted to makehim away\\n he could pull up the sluices\\n and let in suchfloods as would drown all round about him\\nBut to leave Mr\\n Recorder\\n and to come to my Lord Willbewill\\nanother of the gentry of the famous town of Mansoul\\n  ThisWillbewill was as high-born as any man in Mansoul\\n and was asmuch\\n if not more\\n a freeholder than many of them were\\nbesides\\n if I remember my tale aright\\n he had some privilegespeculiar to himself in the famous town of Mansoul\\n  Now\\ntogether with these\\n he was a man of great strength\\nresolution\\n and courage\\n nor in his occasion could any turnhim away\\n  But I say\\n whether he was proud of his estate\\nprivileges\\n strength\\n or what\\n (but sure it was through prideof something\\n) he scorns now to be a slave in Mansoul\\n andtherefore resolves to bear office under Diabolus\\n that hemight (such an one as he was) be a petty ruler and governorin Mansoul\\n  And\\n headstrong man that he was\\n thus he beganbetimes\\n for this man\\n when Diabolus did make his oration atEar-gate\\n was one of the first that was for consenting to hiswords\\n and for accepting his counsel at wholesome\\n and thatwas for the opening of the gate\\n and for letting him into thetown\\n wherefore Diabolus had a kindness for him\\n andtherefore he designed for him a place\\n  And perceiving thevalour and stoutness of the man\\n he coveted to have him forone of his great ones\\n to act and do in matters of thehighest concern\\nSo he sent for him\\n and talked with him of that secret matterthat lay in his breast\\n but there needed not much persuasionin the case\\n  For as at first he was willing that Diabolusshould be let into the town\\n so now he was as willing toserve him there\\n  When the tyrant\\n therefore\\n perceived thewillingness of my lord to serve him\\n and that his mind stoodbending that way\\n he forthwith made him the captain of thecastle\\n governor of the wall\\n and keeper of the gates ofMansoul\\n yea\\n there was a clause in his commission\\n thatnothing without him should be done in all the town ofMansoul\\n  So that now\\n next to Diabolus himself\\n who but myLord Willbewill in all the town of Mansoul\\n nor couldanything now be done\\n but at his will and pleasure\\nthroughout the town of Mansoul\\n  He had also one Mr\\n Mind forhis clerk\\n a man to speak on every way like his master\\n forhe and his lord were in principle one\\n and in practice notfar asunder\\n  And now was Mansoul brought under to purpose\\nand made to fulfil the lusts of the will\\n and of the mind\\nBut it will not out of my thoughts what a desperate one thisWillbewill was when power was put into his hand\\n  First\\n heflatly denied that he owed any suit or service to his formerprince and liege lord\\n  This done\\n in the next place he tookan oath\\n and swore fidelity to his great master Diabolus\\n andthen\\n being stated and settled in his places\\n offices\\nadvancements\\n and preferments\\n oh\\n you cannot think\\n unlessyou had seen it\\n the strange work that this workman made inthe town of Mansoul\\nFirst\\n he maligned Mr\\n Recorder to death\\n he would neitherendure to see him\\n nor hear the words of his mouth\\n he wouldshut his eyes when he saw him\\n and stop his ears when heheard him speak\\n  Also he could not endure that so much as afragment of the law of Shaddai should be anywhere seen in thetown\\n  For example\\n his clerk\\n Mr\\n Mind\\n had some old\\n rent\\nand torn parchments of the law of Shaddai in his house\\n butwhen Willbewill saw them\\n he cast them behind his back\\nTrue\\n Mr\\n Recorder had some of the laws in his study\\n but mylord could by no means come at them\\n  He also thought andsaid\\n that the windows of my old Lord Mayor\\'s house werealways too light for the profit of the town of Mansoul\\n  Thelight of a candle he could not endure\\n  Now nothing at allpleased Willbewill but what pleased Diabolus his lord\\nThere was none like him to trumpet about the streets thebrave nature\\n the wise conduct\\n and great glory of the kingDiabolus\\n  He would range and rove throughout all the streetsof Mansoul to cry up his illustrious lord\\n and would makehimself even as an abject\\n among the base and rascal crew\\n tocry up his valiant prince\\n  And I say\\n when and wheresoeverhe found these vassals\\n he would even make himself as one ofthem\\n  In all ill courses he would act without bidding\\n anddo mischief without commandment\\nThe Lord Willbewill also had a deputy under him\\n and his namewas Mr\\n Affection\\n one that was also greatly debauched in hisprinciples\\n and answerable thereto in his life\\n he was whollygiven to the flesh\\n and therefore they called him Vile-Affection\\n  Now there was he and one Carnal-Lust\\n thedaughter of Mr\\n Mind\\n (like to like\\n) that fell in love\\n andmade a match\\n and were married\\n and\\n as I take it\\n they hadseveral children\\n as Impudent\\n Blackmouth\\n and Hate-Reproof\\nThese three were black boys\\n  And besides these they hadthree daughters\\n as Scorn-Truth and Slight-God\\n and the nameof the youngest was Revenge\\n  These were all married in thetown\\n and also begot and yielded many bad brats\\n too many tobe here inserted\\n  But to pass by this\\nWhen the giant had thus engarrisoned himself in the town ofMansoul\\n and had put down and set up whom he thought good\\n hebetakes himself to defacing\\n  Now there was in the market-place in Mansoul\\n and also upon the gates of the castle\\n animage of the blessed King Shaddai\\n  This image was so exactlyengraven\\n (and it was engraven in gold\\n) that it did the mostresemble Shaddai himself of anything that then was extant inthe world\\n  This he basely commanded to be defaced\\n and itwas as basely done by the hand of Mr\\n No-Truth\\n  Now you mustknow that\\n as Diabolus had commanded\\n and that by the hand ofMr\\n No-Truth\\n the image of Shaddai was defaced\\n he likewisegave order that the same Mr\\n No-Truth should set up in itsstead the horrid and formidable image of Diabolus\\n to thegreat contempt of the former King\\n and debasing of his townof Mansoul\\nMoreover\\n Diabolus made havoc of all remains of the laws andstatutes of Shaddai that could be found in the town ofMansoul\\n to wit\\n such as contained either the doctrines ofmorals\\n with all civil and natural documents\\n  Also relativeseverities he sought to extinguish\\n  To be short\\n there wasnothing of the remains of good in Mansoul which he andWillbewill sought not to destroy\\n for their design was toturn Mansoul into a brute\\n and to make it like to the sensualsow\\n by the hand of Mr\\n No-Truth\\nWhen he had destroyed what law and good orders he could\\n thenfurther to effect his design\\n namely\\n to alienate Mansoulfrom Shaddai her King\\n he commands\\n and they set up his ownvain edicts\\n statutes\\n and commandments\\n in all places ofresort or concourse in Mansoul\\n to wit\\n such as gave libertyto the lusts of the flesh\\n the lusts of the eyes\\n and thepride of life\\n which are not of Shaddai\\n but of the world\\nHe encouraged\\n countenanced\\n and promoted lasciviousness\\n andall ungodliness there\\n  Yea\\n much more did Diabolus toencourage wickedness in the town of Mansoul\\n he promised thempeace\\n content\\n joy\\n and bliss\\n in doing his commands\\n andthat they should never be called to an account for their notdoing the contrary\\n  And let this serve to give a taste tothem that love to hear tell of what is done beyond theirknowledge afar off in other countries\\nNow Mansoul being wholly at his beck\\n and brought wholly tohis bow\\n nothing was heard or seen therein but that whichtended to set up him\\nBut now he\\n having disabled the Lord Mayor and Mr\\n Recorderfrom bearing of office in Mansoul\\n and seeing that the town\\nbefore he came to it\\n was the most ancient of corporations inthe world\\n and fearing\\n if he did not maintain greatness\\nthey at any time should object that he had done them aninjury\\n therefore\\n I say\\n (that they might see that he didnot intend to lessen their grandeur\\n or to take from them anyof their advantageous things\\n) he did choose for them a LordMayor and a Recorder himself\\n and such as contented them atthe heart\\n and such also as pleased him wondrous well\\nThe name of the Mayor that was of Diabolus\\' making was theLord Lustings\\n a man that had neither eyes nor ears\\n  Allthat he did\\n whether as a man or an officer\\n he did itnaturally\\n as doth the beast\\n  And that which made him yetthe more ignoble\\n though not to Mansoul\\n yet to them thatbeheld and were grieved for its ruin\\n was\\n that he nevercould favour good\\n but evil\\nThe Recorder was one whose name was Forget-Good\\n and a verysorry fellow he was\\n  He could remember nothing but mischief\\nand to do it with delight\\n  He was naturally prone to dothings that were hurtful\\n even hurtful to the town ofMansoul\\n and to all the dwellers there\\n  These two\\ntherefore\\n by their power and practice\\n examples\\n and smilesupon evil\\n did much more grammar and settle the common peoplein hurtful ways\\n  For who doth not perceive that when thosethat sit aloft are vile and corrupt themselves\\n they corruptthe whole region and country where they are\\nBesides these\\n Diabolus made several burgesses and aldermenin Mansoul\\n such as out of whom the town\\n when it needed\\nmight choose them officers\\n governors\\n and magistrates\\n  Andthese are the names of the chief of them\\n Mr\\n Incredulity\\nMr\\n Haughty\\n Mr\\n Swearing\\n Mr\\n Whoring\\n Mr\\n Hard-Heart\\n Mr\\nPitiless\\n Mr\\n Fury\\n Mr\\n No-Truth\\n Mr\\n Stand-to-Lies\\n Mr\\nFalse-Peace\\n Mr\\n Drunkenness\\n Mr\\n Cheating\\n Mr\\n Atheism -thirteen in all\\n  Mr\\n Incredulity is the eldest\\n and Mr\\nAtheism the youngest of the company\\nThere was also an election of common councilmen and others\\nas bailiffs\\n sergeants\\n constables\\n and others\\n but all ofthem like to those afore-named\\n being either fathers\\nbrothers\\n cousins\\n or nephews to them\\n whose names\\n forbrevity\\'s sake\\n I omit to mention\\nWhen the giant had thus far proceeded in his work\\n in thenext place\\n he betook him to build some strongholds in thetown\\n and he built three that seemed to be impregnable\\n  Thefirst he called the Hold of Defiance\\n because it was made tocommand the whole town\\n and to keep it from the knowledge ofits ancient King\\n  The second he called Midnight Hold\\nbecause it was built on purpose to keep Mansoul from the trueknowledge of itself\\n  The third was called Sweet-Sin Hold\\nbecause by that he fortified Mansoul against all desires ofgood\\n  The first of these holds stood close by Eye-gate\\nthat\\n as much might be\\n light might be darkened there\\n thesecond was built hard by the old castle\\n to the end that thatmight be made more blind\\n if possible\\n and the third stood inthe market-place\\nHe that Diabolus made governor over the first of these wasone Spite-God\\n a most blasphemous wretch\\n he came with thewhole rabble of them that came against Mansoul at first\\n andwas himself one of themselves\\n  He that was made the governorof Midnight Hold was one Love-no-Light\\n he was also of themthat came first against the town\\n  And he that was made thegovernor of the hold called Sweet-Sin Hold was one whose namewas Love-Flesh\\n he was also a very lewd fellow\\n but not ofthat country where the other are bound\\n  This fellow couldfind more sweetness when he stood sucking of a lust than hedid in all the paradise of God\\nAnd now Diabolus thought himself safe\\n  He had taken Mansoul\\nhe had engarrisoned himself therein\\n he had put down the oldofficers\\n and had set up new ones\\n he had defaced the imageof Shaddai\\n and had set up his own\\n he had spoiled the oldlaw books\\n and had promoted his own vain lies\\n he had madehim new magistrates\\n and set up new aldermen\\n he had buildedhim new holds\\n and had manned them for himself\\n and all thishe did to make himself secure\\n in case the good Shaddai\\n orhis Son\\n should come to make an incursion upon him\\nNow you may well think\\n that long before this time\\n word\\n bysome one or other\\n could not but be carried to the good KingShaddai\\n how his Mansoul\\n in the continent of Universe\\n waslost\\n and that the runagate giant Diabolus\\n once one of hisMajesty\\'s servants\\n had\\n in rebellion against the King\\n madesure thereof for himself\\n  Yea\\n tidings were carried andbrought to the King thereof\\n and that to a very circumstance\\nAt first\\n how Diabolus came upon Mansoul (they being a simplepeople and innocent) with craft\\n subtlety\\n lies\\n and guile\\nITEM\\n that he had treacherously slain the right noble andvaliant captain\\n their Captain Resistance\\n as he stood uponthe gate with the rest of the townsmen\\n  ITEM\\n how my braveLord Innocent fell down dead (with grief\\n some say\\n or withbeing poisoned with the stinking breath of one Ill-Pause\\n assay others) at the hearing of his just lord and rightfulprince\\n Shaddai\\n so abused by the mouth of so filthy aDiabolian as that varlet Ill-Pause was\\n  The messengerfurther told\\n that after this Ill-Pause had made a shortoration to the townsmen in behalf of Diabolus\\n his master\\nthe simple town\\n believing that what was said was true\\n withone consent did open Ear-gate\\n the chief gate of thecorporation\\n and did let him\\n with his crew\\n into apossession of the famous town of Mansoul\\n  He further showedhow Diabolus had served the Lord Mayor and Mr\\n Recorder\\n towit\\n that he had put them from all place of power and trust\\nITEM\\n he showed also that my Lord Willbewill was turned avery rebel\\n and runagate\\n and that so was one Mr\\n Mind\\n hisclerk\\n and that they two did range and revel it all the townover\\n and teach the wicked ones their ways\\n  He said\\nmoreover\\n that this Willbewill was put into great trust\\n andparticularly that Diabolus had put into Willbewill\\'s hand allthe strong places in Mansoul\\n and that Mr\\n Affection was mademy Lord Willbewill\\'s deputy in his most rebellious affairs\\n\\'Yea\\n\\' said the messenger\\n \\'this monster\\n Lord Willbewill\\nhas openly disavowed his King Shaddai\\n and hath horriblygiven his faith and plighted his troth to Diabolus\\n\\'\\'Also\\n\\' said the messenger\\n \\'besides all this\\n the new king\\nor rather rebellious tyrant\\n over the once famous\\n but nowperishing town of Mansoul\\n has set up a Lord Mayor and aRecorder of his own\\n  For Mayor\\n he has set up one Mr\\nLustings\\n and for Recorder\\n Mr\\n Forget-Good\\n two of thevilest of all the town of Mansoul\\n\\'  This faithful messengeralso proceeded\\n and told what a sort of new burgessesDiabolus had made\\n also that he had built several strongforts\\n towers\\n and strongholds in Mansoul\\n  He told\\n too\\n thewhich I had almost forgot\\n how Diabolus had put the town ofMansoul into arms\\n the better to capacitate them\\n on hisbehalf\\n to make resistance against Shaddai their King\\n shouldhe come to reduce them to their former obedience\\nNow this tidings-teller did not deliver his relation ofthings in private\\n but in open court\\n the King and his Son\\nhigh lords\\n chief captains\\n and nobles\\n being all therepresent to hear\\n  But by that they had heard the whole of thestory\\n it would have amazed one to have seen\\n had he beenthere to behold it\\n what sorrow and grief\\n and compunction ofspirit\\n there was among all sorts\\n to think that famousMansoul was now taken\\n only the King and his Son foresaw allthis long before\\n yea\\n and sufficiently provided for therelief of Mansoul\\n though they told not everybody thereof\\nYet because they also would have a share in condoling of theMisery of Mansoul\\n therefore they also did\\n and that at arate of the highest degree\\n bewail the losing of Mansoul\\nThe King said plainly that it grieved him at the heart\\n andyou may be sure that his Son was not a whit behind him\\n  Thusgave they conviction to all about them that they had love andcompassion for the famous town of Mansoul\\n  Well\\n when theKing and his Son were retired into the privy chamber\\n therethey again consulted about what they had designed before\\n towit\\n that as Mansoul should in time be suffered to be lost\\nso as certainly it should be recovered again\\n recovered\\n Isay\\n in such a way\\n as that both the King and his Son wouldget themselves eternal fame and glory thereby\\n  Wherefore\\nafter this consult\\n the Son of Shaddai (a sweet and comelyPerson\\n and one that had always great affection for thosethat were in affliction\\n but one that had mortal enmity inhis heart against Diabolus\\n because he was designed for it\\nand because he sought his crown and dignity) - this Son ofShaddai\\n I say\\n having stricken hands with his Father andpromised that he would be his servant to recover his Mansoulagain\\n stood by his resolution\\n nor would he repent of thesame\\n  The purport of which agreement was this\\n to wit\\n thatat a certain time\\n prefixed by both\\n the King\\'s Son shouldtake a journey into the country of Universe\\n and there\\n in away of justice and equity\\n by making amends for the folliesof Mansoul\\n he should lay a foundation of perfect deliverancefrom Diabolus and from his tyranny\\nMoreover Emmanuel resolved to make\\n at a time convenient\\n awar upon the giant Diabolus\\n even while he was possessed ofthe town of Mansoul\\n and that he would fairly by strength ofhand drive him out of his hold\\n his nest\\n and take it tohimself to be his habitation\\nThis now being resolved upon\\n order was given to the LordChief Secretary to draw up a fair record of what wasdetermined\\n and to cause that it should be published in allthe corners of the kingdom of Universe\\n  A short breviate ofthe contents thereof you may\\n if you please\\n take here asfollows\\n\\'Let all men know who are concerned\\n that the Son of Shaddai\\nthe great King\\n is engaged by covenant to his Father to bringhis Mansoul to him again\\n yea\\n and to put Mansoul\\n too\\nthrough the power of his matchless love\\n into a far betterand more happy condition than it was in before it was takenby Diabolus\\n\\'These papers\\n therefore\\n were published in several places\\n tothe no little molestation of the tyrant Diabolus\\n \\'for now\\n\\'thought he\\n \\'I shall be molested\\n and my habitation will betaken from me\\n\\'But when this matter\\n I mean this purpose of the King and hisSon\\n did at first take air at court\\n who can tell how thehigh lords\\n chief captains\\n and noble princes that werethere\\n were taken with the business\\n  First\\n they whisperedit one to another\\n and after that it began to ring outthrough the King\\'s palace\\n all wondering at the gloriousdesign that between the King and his Son was on foot for themiserable town of Mansoul\\n  Yea\\n the courtiers could scarcedo anything either for the King or kingdom\\n but they wouldmix\\n with the doing thereof\\n a noise of the love of the Kingand his Son\\n that they had for the town of Mansoul\\nNor could these lords\\n high captains\\n and princes be contentto keep this news at court\\n yea\\n before the records thereofwere perfected\\n themselves came down and told it in Universe\\nAt last it came to the ears\\n as I said\\n of Diabolus\\n to hisno little discontent\\n for you must think it would perplex himto hear of such a design against him\\n  Well\\n but after a fewcasts in his mind\\n he concluded upon these four things\\nFirst\\n that this news\\n these good tidings\\n (if possible\\n)should be kept from the ears of the town of Mansoul\\n \\'for\\n\\'said he\\n \\'if they should once come to the knowledge thatShaddai\\n their former King\\n and Emmanuel his Son\\n arecontriving good for the town of Mansoul\\n what can be expectedby me\\n but that Mansoul will make a revolt from under my handand government\\n and return again to him\\n\\'Now\\n to accomplish this his design\\n he renews his flatterywith my Lord Willbewill\\n and also gives him strict charge andcommand\\n that he should keep watch by day and by night at allthe gates of the town\\n especially Ear-gate and Eye-gate\\n \\'forI hear of a design\\n\\' quoth he\\n \\'a design to make us alltraitors\\n and that Mansoul must be reduced to its firstbondage again\\n  I hope they are but flying stories\\n\\' quothhe\\n \\'however\\n let no such news by any means be let intoMansoul\\n lest the people be dejected thereat\\n  I think\\n mylord\\n it can be no welcome news to you\\n I am sure it is noneto me\\n and I think that\\n at this time\\n it should be all ourwisdom and care to nip the head of all such rumours as shalltend to trouble our people\\n  Wherefore I desire\\n my lord\\nthat you will in this matter do as I say\\n  Let there bestrong guards daily kept at every gate of the town\\n  Stopalso and examine from whence such come that you perceive dofrom far come hither to trade\\n nor let them by any means beadmitted into Mansoul\\n unless you shall plainly perceive thatthey are favourers of our excellent government\\n  I command\\nmoreover\\n\\' said Diabolus\\n \\'that there be spies continuallywalking up and down the town of Mansoul\\n and let them havepower to suppress and destroy any that they shall perceive tobe plotting against us\\n or that shall prate of what byShaddai and Emmanuel is intended\\n\\'This\\n therefore\\n was accordingly done\\n my Lord Willbewillhearkened to his lord and master\\n went willingly after thecommandment\\n and\\n with all the diligence he could\\n kept anythat would from going out abroad\\n or that sought to bringthese tidings to Mansoul\\n from coming into the town\\nSecondly\\n this done\\n in the next place\\n Diabolus\\n that hemight make Mansoul as sure as he could\\n frames and imposes anew oath and horrible covenant upon the townsfolk\\n- To wit\\nthat they should never desert him nor his government\\n nor yetbetray him\\n nor seek to alter his laws\\n but that they shouldown\\n confess\\n stand by\\n and acknowledge him for theirrightful king\\n in defiance to any that do or hereafter shall\\nby any pretence\\n law\\n or title whatever\\n lay claim to thetown of Mansoul\\n thinking\\n belike\\n that Shaddai had not powerto absolve them from this covenant with death\\n and agreementwith hell\\n  Nor did the silly Mansoul stick or boggle at allat this most monstrous engagement\\n but\\n as if it had been asprat in the mouth of a whale\\n they swallowed it without anychewing\\n  Were they troubled at all\\n  Nay\\n they ratherbragged and boasted of their so brave fidelity to the tyrant\\ntheir pretended king\\n swearing that they would never bechangelings\\n nor forsake their old lord for a new\\n  Thus didDiabolus tie poor Mansoul fast\\nThirdly\\n  But jealousy\\n that never thinks itself strongenough\\n put him\\n in the next place\\n upon another exploit\\nwhich was\\n yet more\\n if possible\\n to debauch this town ofMansoul\\n  Wherefore he caused\\n by the hand of one Mr\\n Filth\\nan odious\\n nasty\\n lascivious piece of beastliness to be drawnup in writing\\n and to be set upon the castle gates\\n wherebyhe granted and gave license to all his true and trusty sonsin Mansoul to do whatsoever their lustful appetites promptedthem to do\\n and that no man was to let\\n hinder\\n or controlthem\\n upon pain of incurring the displeasure of their prince\\nNow this he did for these reasons\\n-1\\n That the town of Mansoul might be yet made weaker andweaker\\n and so more unable\\n should tidings come that theirredemption was designed\\n to believe\\n hope\\n or consent to thetruth thereof\\n for reason says\\n The bigger the sinner\\n theless grounds of hopes of mercy\\n2\\n The second reason was\\n if perhaps Emmanuel\\n the Son ofShaddai their King\\n by seeing the horrible and profane doingsof the town of Mansoul\\n might repent\\n though entered into acovenant of redeeming them\\n of pursuing that covenant oftheir redemption\\n for he knew that Shaddai was holy\\n and thathis Son Emmanuel was holy\\n yea\\n he knew it by woefulexperience\\n for for his iniquity and sin was Diabolus castfrom the highest orbs\\n  Wherefore what more rational than forhim to conclude that thus\\n for sin\\n it might fare withMansoul\\n  But fearing also lest this knot should break\\n hebethinks himself of another\\n to wit\\n-Fourthly\\n  To endeavour to possess all hearts in the town ofMansoul that Shaddai was raising an army\\n to come tooverthrow and utterly to destroy this town of Mansoul\\n  Andthis he did to forestall any tidings that might come to theirears of their deliverance\\n \\'For\\n\\' thought he\\n \\'if I firstbruit this\\n the tidings that shall come after will all beswallowed up of this\\n for what else will Mansoul say\\n whenthey shall hear that they must be delivered\\n but that thetrue meaning is\\n Shaddai intends to destroy them\\n  Whereforehe summons the whole town into the market-place\\n and there\\nwith deceitful tongue\\n thus he addressed himself unto them\\n-\\'Gentlemen\\n and my very good friends\\n you are all\\n as youknow\\n my legal subjects\\n and men of the famous town ofMansoul\\n  You know how\\n from the first day that I have beenwith you until now\\n I have behaved myself among you\\n and whatliberty and great privileges you have enjoyed under mygovernment\\n I hope to your honour and mine\\n and also to yourcontent and delight\\n  Now\\n my famous Mansoul\\n a noise oftrouble there is abroad\\n of trouble to the town of Mansoul\\nsorry I am thereof for your sakes\\n for I received but now bythe post from my Lord Lucifer\\n (and he useth to have goodintelligence\\n) that your old King Shaddai is raising an armyto come against you\\n to destroy you root and branch\\n andthis\\n O Mansoul\\n is now the cause that at this time I havecalled you together\\n namely\\n to advise what in this junctureis best to be done\\n  For my part\\n I am but one\\n and can withease shift for myself\\n did I list

out together\\n\\'Let him die the death that will not\\n\\'Then said Diabolus again\\n \\'It is in vain for us to hope forquarter\\n for this King knows not how to show it\\n  True\\nperhaps\\n he\\n at his first sitting down before us\\n will talkof and pretend to mercy\\n that thereby\\n with the more ease\\nand less trouble\\n he may again make himself the master ofMansoul\\n  Whatever\\n therefore\\n he shall say\\n believe not onesyllable or tittle of it\\n for all such language is but toovercome us\\n and to make us\\n while we wallow in our blood\\nthe trophies of his merciless

of our lives\\nI hope you know more of the rudiments of politics than tosuffer yourselves so pitifully to be served\\n\\'But suppose he should\\n if he get us to yield\\n save some ofour lives\\n or the lives of some of them that are underlingsin Mansoul\\n what help will that be to you that are the chiefof the town\\n especially you whom I have set up and whosegreatness has been procured by you

Mansoul\\n\\'2\\n My breastplate is a breastplate of iron\\n  I had it forgedin mine own country\\n and all my soldiers are armed therewith\\nIn plain language\\n it is a hard heart\\n a heart as hard

good and lawful KingShaddai\\n in the next place\\n he doubleth his guards at thegates of the town\\n and he takes himself to the castle\\n whichwas his stronghold\\n  His vassals also\\n to show their wills\\nand supposed (but ignoble) gallantry\\n exercise themselves intheir arms every day\\n and teach one another feats of war\\nthey also defied their enemies\\n and sang up the praises oftheir tyrant\\n they threatened also what men they would be ifever things should rise so high as a war between Shaddai andtheir king\\nNow all this time the good King\\n the King Shaddai\\n waspreparing to send an army to recover the town of Mansoulagain from under the tyranny of their pretended kingDiabolus\\n but he thought good\\n at first\\n not to send them bythe hand and conduct of brave Emmanuel his Son\\n but under thehand of some of his servants\\n to see first by them the temperof Mansoul\\n and whether by them they would be won to theobedience of their King\\n  The army consisted of above fortythousand\\n all true men\\n for they came from the King\\'s owncourt\\n and were those of his own choosing\\nThey came up to Mansoul under the conduct of four stoutgenerals\\n each man being a captain of ten thousand men\\n andthese are their names and their ensigns\\n  The name of thefirst was Boanerges\\n the name of the second was CaptainConviction\\n the name of the third was Captain Judgment\\n andthe name of the fourth was Captain Execution\\n  These were thecaptains that Shaddai sent to regain Mansoul\\nThese four captains\\n as was said\\n the King thought fit\\n inthe first place\\n to send to Mansoul\\n to make an attempt uponit\\n for indeed generally in all his wars he did use to sendthese four captains in the van\\n for they were very stout andrough-hewn men\\n men that were fit to break the ice\\n and tomake their way by dint of sword\\n and their men were likethemselves\\nTo each of these captains the King gave a banner\\n that itmight be displayed\\n because of the goodness of his cause\\n andbecause of the right that he had to Mansoul\\nFirst\\n to Captain Boanerges\\n for he was the chief\\n to him\\n Isay\\n were given ten thousand men\\n  His ensign was Mr\\nThunder\\n he bare the black colours\\n and his scutcheon was thethree burning thunderbolts\\nThe second captain was Captain Conviction\\n to him also weregiven ten thousand men\\n  His ensign\\'s name was Mr\\n Sorrow\\n hedid bear the pale colours\\n and his scutcheon was the book ofthe law wide open\\n from whence issued a flame of fire\\nThe third captain was Captain Judgment\\n to him were given tenthousand men\\n  His ensign\\'s name was Mr\\n Terror\\n he bare thered colours\\n and his scutcheon was a burning fiery furnace\\nThe fourth captain was Captain Execution\\n to him were giventen thousand men\\n  His ensign was one Mr\\n Justice\\n he alsobare the red colours\\n and his scutcheon was a fruitless tree\\nwith an axe lying at the root thereof\\nThese four captains\\n as I said\\n had every one of them underhis command ten thousand men\\n all of good fidelity to theKing\\n and stout at their military actions\\nWell\\n the captains and their forces\\n their men and underofficers\\n being had upon a day by Shaddai into the field\\n andthere called all over by their names\\n were then and there putinto such harness as became their degree and that servicewhich now they were going about for their King\\nNow\\n when the King had mustered his forces\\n (for it is hethat mustereth the host to the battle\\n) he gave unto thecaptains their several commissions\\n with charge andcommandment in the audience of all the soldiers\\n that theyshould take heed faithfully and courageously to do andexecute the same\\n  Their commissions were\\n for the substanceof them\\n the same in form\\n though\\n as to name\\n title\\n placeand degree of the captains\\n there might be some\\n but verysmall variation\\n  And here let me give you an account of thematter and sum contained in their commission\\nA COMMISSION FROM THE GREAT SHADDAI\\n KING OF MANSOUL\\n TO HISTRUSTY AND NOBLE CAPTAIN\\n THE CAPTAIN BOANERGES\\n FOR HISMAKING WAR UPON THE TOWN OF MANSOUL\\n\\'O\\n thou Boanerges\\n one of my stout and thundering captainsover one ten thousand of my valiant and faithful servants\\n gothou in my name\\n with this thy force\\n to the miserable townof Mansoul\\n and when thou comest thither\\n offer them firstconditions of peace\\n and command them that\\n casting off theyoke and tyranny of the wicked Diabolus\\n they return to me\\ntheir rightful Prince and Lord\\n  Command them also that theycleanse themselves from all that is his in the town ofMansoul\\n and look to thyself\\n that thou hast goodsatisfaction touching the truth of their obedience\\n  Thuswhen thou hast commanded them\\n (if they in truth submitthereto\\n) then do thou\\n to the uttermost of thy power\\n whatin thee lies to set up for me a garrison in the famous townof Mansoul\\n nor do thou hurt the least native that moveth orbreatheth therein\\n if they will submit themselves to me\\n buttreat thou such as if they were thy friend or brother\\n forall such I love\\n and they shall be dear unto me\\n and tellthem that I will take a time to come unto them\\n and to letthem know that I am merciful\\n\\'But if they shall\\n notwithstanding thy summons and theproducing of thy authority\\n resist\\n stand out against thee\\nand rebel\\n then do I command thee to make use of all thycunning\\n power\\n might\\n and force\\n to bring them under bystrength of hand\\n  Farewell\\n\\'Thus you see the sum of their commissions\\n for\\n as I saidbefore\\n for the substance of them\\n they were the same thatthe rest of the noble captains had\\nWherefore they\\n having received each commander his authorityat the hand of their King\\n the day being appointed\\n and theplace of their rendezvous prefixed\\n each commander appearedin such gallantry as became his cause and calling\\n  So\\n aftera new entertainment from Shaddai\\n with flying colours theyset forward to march towards the famous town of Mansoul\\nCaptain Boanerges led the van\\n Captain Conviction and CaptainJudgment made up the main body\\n and Captain Execution broughtup the rear\\n  They then\\n having a great way to go\\n (for thetown of Mansoul was far off from the court of Shaddai\\n)marched through the regions and countries of many people\\n nothurting or abusing any\\n but blessing wherever they came\\nThey also lived upon the King\\'s cost in all the way theywent\\nHaving travelled thus for many days\\n at last they came withinsight of Mansoul\\n the which when they saw\\n the captains couldfor their hearts do no less than for a while bewail thecondition of the town\\n for they quickly saw how that it wasprostrate to the will of Diabolus\\n and to his ways anddesigns\\nWell\\n to be short\\n the captains came up before the town\\nmarch up to Ear-gate\\n sit down there (for that was the placeof hearing)\\n  So\\n when they had pitched their tents andentrenched themselves\\n they addressed themselves to maketheir assault\\nNow the townsfolk at first\\n beholding so gallant a company\\nso bravely accoutred\\n and so excellently disciplined\\n havingon their glittering armour\\n and displaying of their flyingcolours\\n could not but come out of their houses and gaze\\nBut the cunning fox Diabolus\\n fearing that the people\\n afterthis sight\\n should\\n on a sudden summons\\n open the gates tothe captains\\n came down with all haste from the castle\\n andmade them retire into the body of the town\\n who\\n when he hadthem there\\n made this lying and deceivable speech unto them\\n\\'Gentlemen\\n\\' quoth he\\n \\'although you are my trusty and well-beloved friends\\n yet I cannot but a little chide you for yourlate uncircumspect action\\n in going out to gaze on that greatand mighty force that but yesterday sat down before\\n and havenow entrenched themselves in order to the maintaining of asiege against the famous town of Mansoul\\n  Do you know whothey are\\n whence they come\\n and what is their purpose insitting down before the town of Mansoul\\n  They are they ofwhom I have told you long ago\\n that they would come todestroy this town\\n and against whom I have been at the costto arm you with CAP-A-PIE for your body\\n besides greatfortifications for your mind\\n  Wherefore\\n then\\n did you notrather\\n even at the first appearance of them\\n cry out\\n \"Firethe beacons\\n\" and give the whole town an alarm concerningthem\\n that we might all have been in a posture of defence\\nand been ready to have received them with the highest acts ofdefiance\\n  Then had you showed yourselves men to my liking\\nwhereas\\n by what you have done\\n you have made me half afraid- I say\\n half afraid - that when they and we shall come topush a pike\\n I shall find you want courage to stand it outany longer\\n  Wherefore have I commanded a watch\\n and that youshould double your guards at the gates\\n  Wherefore have Iendeavoured to make you as hard as iron\\n and your hearts as apiece of the nether millstone\\n  Was it\\n think you\\n that youmight show yourselves women\\n and that you might go out like acompany of innocents to gaze on your mortal foes\\n  Fie\\n fie\\nput yourselves into a posture of defence\\n beat up the drum\\ngather together in warlike manner\\n that our foes may knowthat\\n before they shall conquer this corporation\\n there arevaliant men in the town of Mansoul\\n\\'I will leave off now to chide\\n and will not further rebukeyou\\n but I charge you\\n that henceforwards you let me see nomore such actions\\n  Let not henceforward a man of you\\nwithout order first obtained from me\\n so much as show hishead over the wall of the town of Mansoul\\n  You have nowheard me\\n do as I have commanded\\n and you shall cause me thatI dwell securely with you\\n and that I take care\\n as formyself\\n so for your safety and honour also\\n  Farewell\\n\"Now were the townsmen strangely altered\\n they were as menstricken with a panic fear\\n they ran to and fro through thestreets of the town of Mansoul\\n crying out\\n \\'Help\\n help\\n themen that turn the world upside down are come hither also\\n\\'Nor could any of them be quiet after\\n but still\\n as menbereft of wit\\n they cried out\\n \\'The destroyers of our peaceand people are come\\n\\'  This went down with Diabolus\\n  \\'Ah\\n\\'quoth he to himself\\n \\'this I like well\\n now it is as I wouldhave it\\n now you show your obedience to your prince\\n  Holdyou but here\\n and then let them take the town if they can\\n\\'Well\\n before the King\\'s forces had sat before Mansoul threedays\\n Captain Boanerges commanded his trumpeter to go down toEar-gate\\n and there\\n in the name of the great Shaddai\\n tosummon Mansoul to give audience to the message that he\\n inhis Master\\'s name\\n was to them commanded to deliver\\n  So thetrumpeter\\n whose name was Take-heed-what-you-hear\\n went up\\nas he was commanded\\n to Ear-gate\\n and there sounded histrumpet for a hearing\\n but there was none that appeared thatgave answer or regard\\n for so had Diabolus commanded\\n  So thetrumpeter returned to his captain\\n and told him what he haddone\\n and also how he had sped\\n whereat the captain wasgrieved\\n but bid the trumpeter go to his tent\\nAgain Captain Boanerges sendeth his trumpeter to Ear-gate\\n tosound as before for a hearing\\n but they again kept close\\ncame not out\\n nor would they give him an answer\\n so observantwere they of the command of Diabolus their king\\nThen the captains and other field officers called a councilof war\\n to consider what further was to be done for thegaining of the town of Mansoul\\n and\\n after some close andthorough debate upon the contents of their commissions\\n theyconcluded yet to give to the town\\n by the hand of the fore-named trumpeter\\n another summons to hear\\n but if that shallbe refused\\n said they\\n and that the town shall stand it outstill\\n then they determined\\n and bid the trumpeter tell themso\\n that they would endeavour\\n by what means they could\\n tocompel them by force to the obedience of their King\\nSo Captain Boanerges commanded his trumpeter to go up to Ear-gate again\\n and\\n in the name of the great King Shaddai\\n togive it a very loud summons to come down without delay toEar-gate\\n there to give audience to the King\\'s most noblecaptains\\n  So the trumpeter went\\n and did as he wascommanded\\n he went up to Ear-gate\\n and sounded his trumpet\\nand gave a third summons to Mansoul\\n  He said\\n moreover\\n thatif this they should still refuse to do\\n the captains of hisprince would with might come down upon them\\n and endeavour toreduce them to their obedience by force\\nThen stood up my Lord Willbewill\\n who was the governor of thetown\\n (this Willbewill was that apostate of whom mention wasmade before\\n) and the keeper of the gates of Mansoul\\n  Hetherefore\\n with big and ruffling words\\n demanded of thetrumpeter who he was\\n whence he came\\n and what was the causeof his making so hideous a noise at the gate\\n and speakingsuch insufferable words against the town of Mansoul\\nThe trumpeter answered\\n \\'I am servant to the most noblecaptain\\n Captain Boanerges\\n general of the forces of thegreat King Shaddai\\n against whom both thyself\\n with the wholetown of Mansoul\\n have rebelled\\n and lift up the heel\\n and mymaster\\n the captain\\n hath a special message to this town\\n andto thee\\n as a member thereof\\n the which if you of Mansoulshall peaceably hear\\n so\\n and if not\\n you must take whatfollows\\n\\'Then said the Lord Willbewill\\n \\'I will carry thy words to mylord\\n and will know what he will say\\n\\'But the trumpeter soon replied\\n saying\\n  \\'Our message is notto the giant Diabolus\\n but to the miserable town of Mansoul\\nnor shall we at all regard what answer by him is made\\n noryet by any for him\\n  We are sent to this town to recover itfrom under his cruel tyranny\\n and to persuade it to submit\\nas in former times it did\\n to the most excellent KingShaddai\\n\\'Then said the Lord Willbewill\\n \\'I will do your errand to thetown\\n\\'The trumpeter then replied\\n \\'Sir\\n do not deceive us\\n lest\\n inso doing\\n you deceive yourselves much more\\n\\'  He added\\nmoreover\\n \\'For we are resolved\\n if in peaceable manner you donot submit yourselves\\n then to make a war upon you\\n and tobring you under by force\\n  And of the truth of what I nowsay\\n this shall be a sign unto you\\n - you shall see the blackflag\\n with its hot\\n burning thunder-bolts\\n set upon the mountto-morrow\\n as a token of defiance against your prince\\n and ofour resolutions to reduce you to your Lord and rightfulKing\\n\\'So the said Lord Willbewill returned from off the wall\\n andthe trumpeter came into the camp\\n  When the trumpeter wascome into the camp\\n the captains and officers of the mightyKing Shaddai came together to know if he had obtained ahearing\\n and what was the effect of his errand\\n  So thetrumpeter told\\n saying\\n \\'When I had sounded my trumpet\\n andhad called aloud to the town for a hearing\\n my LordWillbewill\\n the governor of the town\\n and he that hath chargeof the gates\\n came up when he heard me sound\\n and\\n lookingover the wall\\n he asked me what I was\\n whence I came\\n andwhat was the cause of my making this noise\\n  So I told him myerrand\\n and by whose authority I brought it\\n  \"Then\\n\" saidhe\\n \"I will tell it to the governor and to Mansoul\\n\" and thenI returned to my lords\\n\\'Then said the brave Boanerges\\n \\'Let us yet for a while liestill in our trenches\\n and see what these rebels will do\\n\\'Now when the time drew nigh that audience by Mansoul must begiven to the brave Boanerges and his companions\\n it wascommanded that all the men of war throughout the whole campof Shaddai should as one man stand to their arms\\n and makethemselves ready\\n if the town of Mansoul shall hear\\n toreceive it forthwith to mercy\\n but if not\\n to force asubjection\\n  So the day being come\\n the trumpeters sounded\\nand that throughout the whole camp\\n that the men of war mightbe in a readiness for that which then should be the work ofthe day\\n  But when they that were in the town of Mansoulheard the sound of the trumpets throughout the camp ofShaddai\\n and thinking no other but that it must be in orderto storm the corporation\\n they at first were put to greatconsternation of spirit\\n but after they a little were settledagain\\n they also made what preparation they could for a war\\nif they did storm\\n else\\n to secure themselves\\nWell\\n when the utmost time was come\\n Boanerges was resolvedto hear their answer\\n wherefore he sent out his trumpeteragain to summon Mansoul to a hearing of the message that theyhad brought from Shaddai\\nSo he went and sounded\\n and the townsmen came up\\n but madeEar-gate as sure as they could\\n  Now when they were come upto the top of the wall\\n Captain Boanerges desired to see theLord Mayor\\n but my Lord Incredulity was then Lord Mayor\\n forhe came in the room of my Lord Lustings\\n  So Incredulity cameup and showed himself over the wall\\n but when the CaptainBoanerges had set his eyes upon him\\n he cried out aloud\\n\\'This is not he\\n where is my Lord Understanding\\n the ancientLord Mayor of the town of Mansoul\\n for to him I would delivermy message\\n\\'Then said the giant (for Diabolus was also come down) to thecaptain\\n \\'Mr\\n  Captain\\n you have by your boldness given toMansoul at least four summonses to subject herself to yourKing\\n by whose authority I know not\\n nor will I dispute thatnow\\n  I ask\\n therefore\\n what is the reason of all this ado\\nor what would you be at if you knew yourselves\\n\\'Then Captain Boanerges\\n whose were the black colours\\n andwhose scutcheon was the three burning thunderbolts\\n taking nonotice of the giant or of his speech\\n thus addressed himselfto the town of Mansoul\\n \\'Be it known unto you\\n O unhappy andrebellious Mansoul\\n that the most gracious King\\n the greatKing Shaddai\\n my Master\\n hath sent me unto you withcommission\\' (and so he showed to the town his broad seal) \\'toreduce you to his obedience\\n and he hath commanded me\\n incase you yield upon my summons\\n to carry it to you as if youwere my friends or brethren\\n but he also hath bid\\n that if\\nafter summons to submit you still stand out and rebel\\n weshould endeavour to take you by force\\n\\'Then stood forth Captain Conviction\\n and said\\n (his were thepale colours\\n and for a scutcheon he had the book of the lawwide open\\n etc\\n\\n) \\'Hear\\n O Mansoul\\n  Thou\\n O Mansoul\\n wastonce famous for innocency\\n but now thou art degenerated intolies and deceit\\n  Thou hast heard what my brother\\n theCaptain Boanerges\\n hath said\\n and it is your wisdom\\n and willbe your happiness\\n to stoop to\\n and accept of conditions ofpeace and mercy when offered\\n specially when offered by oneagainst whom thou hast rebelled\\n and one who is of power totear thee in pieces\\n for so is Shaddai\\n our King\\n nor\\n whenhe is angry\\n can anything stand before him\\n  If you say youhave not sinned\\n or acted rebellion against our King\\n thewhole of your doings since the day that you cast off hisservice (and there was the beginning of your sin) willsufficiently testify against you\\n  What else means yourhearkening to the tyrant\\n and your receiving him for yourking\\n  What means else your rejecting of the laws of Shaddai\\nand your obeying of Diabolus\\n  Yea\\n what means this yourtaking up of arms against\\n and the shutting of your gatesupon us\\n the faithful servants of your King\\n  Be ruled then\\nand accept of my brother\\'s invitation\\n and overstand not thetime of mercy\\n but agree with thine adversary quickly\\n  Ah\\nMansoul\\n suffer not thyself to be kept from mercy\\n and to berun into a thousand miseries\\n by the flattering wiles ofDiabolus\\n  Perhaps that piece of deceit may attempt to makeyou believe that we seek our own profit in this our service\\nbut know it is obedience to our King\\n and love to yourhappiness\\n that is the cause of this undertaking of ours\\n\\'Again I say to thee\\n O Mansoul\\n consider if it be notamazing grace that Shaddai should so humble himself as hedoth\\n now he\\n by us\\n reasons with you\\n in a way of entreatyand sweet persuasions\\n that you would subject yourselves tohim\\n  Has he that need of you that we are sure you have ofhim\\n  No\\n no\\n but he is merciful\\n and will not that Mansoulshould die\\n but turn to him and live\\n\\'Then stood forth Captain Judgment\\n whose were the redcolours\\n and for a scutcheon he had the burning fieryfurnace\\n and he said\\n \\'O ye\\n the inhabitants of the town ofMansoul\\n that have lived so long in rebellion and acts oftreason against the King Shaddai\\n know that we come not to-day to this place\\n in this manner\\n with our message of ourown minds\\n or to revenge our own quarrel\\n it is the King\\n myMaster\\n that hath sent us to reduce you to your obedience tohim\\n the which if you refuse in a peaceable way to yield\\n wehave commission to compel you thereto\\n  And never think ofyourselves\\n nor yet suffer the tyrant Diabolus to persuadeyou to think\\n that our King\\n by his power\\n is not able tobring you down\\n and to lay you under his feet\\n for he is theformer of all things\\n and if he touches the mountains\\n theysmoke\\n  Nor will the gate of the King\\'s clemency stand alwaysopen\\n for the day that shall burn like an oven is before him\\nyea\\n it hasteth greatly\\n it slumbereth not\\n\\'O Mansoul\\n is it little in thine eyes that our King dothoffer thee mercy\\n and that after so many provocations\\n  Yea\\nhe still holdeth out his golden sceptre to thee\\n and will notyet suffer his gate to be shut against thee\\n wilt thouprovoke him to do it\\n  If so\\n consider of what I say\\n to theeit is opened no more for ever\\n  If thou sayest thou shalt notsee him\\n yet judgment is before him\\n therefore trust thou inhim\\n  Yea\\n because there is wrath\\n beware lest he take theeaway with his stroke\\n then a great ransom cannot deliverthee\\n  Will he esteem thy riches\\n  No\\n not gold\\n nor all theforces of strength\\n  He hath prepared his throne forjudgment\\n for he will come with fire\\n and with his chariotslike a whirlwind\\n to render his anger with fury\\n and hisrebukes with flames of fire\\n  Therefore\\n O Mansoul\\n take heedlest\\n after thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked\\njustice and judgment should take hold of thee\\n\\'Now while the Captain Judgment was making this oration to thetown of Mansoul\\n it was observed by some that Diabolustrembled\\n but he proceeded in his parable and said\\n \\'O thouwoful town of Mansoul\\n wilt thou not yet set open thy gate toreceive us\\n the deputies of thy King\\n and those that

one would drink sweet wine\\n the sea of wrath that our Kinghas prepared for Diabolus and his angels\\n  Consider\\n betimesconsider\\n\\'Then stood forth the fourth captain\\n the noble CaptainExecution\\n and said\\n \\'O town of Mansoul\\n once famous\\n but nowlike the fruitless bough\\n once the delight of the high ones\\nbut now a den for Diabolus\\n hearken also to me\\n and to thewords that I shall speak to thee in the name of the greatShaddai\\n  Behold\\n the axe is laid to the root of the trees\\nevery tree\\n therefore\\n that bringeth not forth good fruit\\n ishewn down and cast into the fire\\n\\'Thou\\n O town of Mansoul\\n hast hitherto been this fruitlesstree\\n thou bearest nought but thorns and briars\\n  Thy evilfruit bespeaks thee not to be a good tree\\n thy grapes aregrapes of gall\\n thy clusters are bitter\\n  Thou hast rebelledagainst thy King\\n and\\n lo\\n we\\n the power and force ofShaddai\\n are the axe that is laid to thy root\\n  What sayestthou\\n  Wilt thou turn\\n  I say again\\n tell me\\n before thefirst blow is given\\n wilt thou turn\\n  Our axe must first belaid TO thy root before it be laid AT thy root\\n it must

What wilt thou do\\n  Wilt thou turn\\n or shall Ismite\\n  If I fetch my blow\\n Mansoul\\n down you go\\n for I havecommission to lay my axe AT as well as TO thy roots\\n nor willanything but yielding to our King prevent doing of execution\\nWhat art thou fit for\\n O Mansoul\\n if mercy preventeth not\\nbut to be hewn down\\n and cast into the fire and burned\\n\\'O Mansoul\\n patience and forbearance do not act for ever\\n ayear\\n or two\\n or three\\n they may\\n but if thou provoke by athree years\\' rebellion\\n (and thou hast already done more thanthis\\n) then what follows but\\n \\'Cut it down\\'\\n nay\\n \\'After thatthou shalt cut it down\\n\\'  And dost thou think that these arebut threatenings\\n or that our King has not power to executehis words\\n  O Mansoul\\n thou wilt find that in the words ofour King\\n when they are by sinners made little or light of\\nthere is not only threatening\\n but burning coals of fire\\n\\'Thou hast been a cumber-ground long already\\n and wilt thoucontinue so still\\n  Thy sin has brought this army to thywalls\\n and shall it bring it in judgment to do execution intothy town\\n  Thou hast heard what the captains have said\\n butas yet thou shuttest thy gates\\n  Speak out\\n Mansoul\\n wiltthou do so still\\n or wilt thou accept of conditions ofpeace\\n\\'These brave speeches of these four noble captains the town ofMansoul refused to hear\\n yet a sound thereof did beat againstEar-gate\\n though the force thereof could not break it open\\nIn fine\\n the town desired a time to prepare their answer tothese demands\\n  The captains then told them\\n that if theywould throw out to them one Ill-Pause that was in the town\\nthat they might reward him according to his works\\n then theywould give them time to consider\\n but if they would not casthim to them over the wall of Mansoul\\n then they would givethem none\\n \\'for\\n\\' said they\\n \\'we know that\\n so long as Ill-Pause draws breath in Mansoul\\n all good consideration will beconfounded\\n and nothing but mischief will come thereon\\n\\'Then Diabolus\\n who was there present\\n being loath to lose hisIll-Pause\\n because he was his orator\\n (and yet be sure hehad\\n could the captains have laid their fingers on him\\n) wasresolved at this instant to give them answer by himself\\n butthen changing his mind\\n he commanded the then Lord Mayor\\n theLord Incredulity\\n to do it\\n saying\\n \\'My lord\\n do you givethese runagates an answer\\n and speak out\\n that Mansoul mayhear and understand you\\n\\'So Incredulity\\n at Diabolus\\' command\\n began\\n and said\\n\\'Gentlemen\\n you have here\\n as we do behold\\n to thedisturbance of our prince and the molestation of the town ofMansoul\\n camped against it\\n but from whence you come\\n we willnot know\\n and what you are\\n we will not believe\\n  Indeed\\n youtell us in your terrible speech that you have this authorityfrom Shaddai\\n but by what right he commands you to do it\\n ofthat we shall yet be ignorant\\n\\'You have also\\n by the authority aforesaid\\n summoned thistown to desert her lord\\n and\\n for protection\\n to yield upherself to the great Shaddai\\n your King\\n flatteringly tellingher\\n that if she will do it\\n he will pass by and not chargeher with her past offences\\n\\'Further\\n you have also\\n to the terror of the town ofMansoul\\n threatened with great and sore destructions topunish this corporation\\n if she consents not to do as yourwills would have her\\n\\'Now\\n captains\\n from whencesoever you come\\n and though yourdesigns be ever so right\\n yet know ye that neither my LordDiabolus\\n nor I\\n his servant\\n Incredulity\\n nor yet our braveMansoul\\n doth regard either your persons\\n message\\n or theKing that you say hath sent you\\n  His power\\n his greatness\\nhis vengeance\\n we fear not\\n nor will we yield at all to yoursummons\\n\\'As for the war that you threaten to make upon us\\n we musttherein defend ourselves as well as we can\\n and know ye\\n thatwe are not without wherewithal to bid defiance to you\\n and\\nin short\\n (for I will not be tedious\\n) I tell you\\n that wetake you to be some vagabond runagate crew\\n that havingshaken off all obedience to your King\\n have gotten togetherin tumultuous manner\\n and are ranging from place to place tosee if\\n through the flatteries you are skilled to make on theone side\\n and threats wherewith you think to fright on theother\\n to make some silly town\\n city\\n or country\\n deserttheir place\\n and leave it to you\\n but Mansoul is none ofthem\\n\\'To conclude\\n we dread you not\\n we fear you not\\n nor will weobey your summons\\n  Our gates we will shut upon you\\n ourplace we will keep you out of\\n  Nor will we long thus sufferyou to sit down before us\\n our people must live in quiet\\nyour appearance doth disturb them\\n  Wherefore arise with bagand baggage\\n and begone\\n or we will let fly from the wallsagainst you\\n\\'This oration\\n made by old Incredulity\\n was seconded bydesperate Willbewill\\n in words to this effect\\n \\'Gentlemen\\n wehave heard your demands\\n and the noise of your threats\\n andhave heard the sound of your summons\\n but we fear not yourforce\\n we regard not your threats\\n but will still abide asyou found us\\n  And we command you\\n that in three days\\' timeyou cease to appear in these parts\\n or you shall know what itis once to dare offer to rouse the lion Diabolus when asleepin his town of Mansoul\\n\\'The Recorder\\n whose name was Forget-Good\\n he also added asfolloweth\\n \\'Gentlemen\\n my lords\\n as you see\\n have with mildand gentle words answered your rough and angry speeches\\n theyhave\\n moreover\\n in my hearing\\n given you leave quietly todepart as you came\\n wherefore\\n take their kindness and begone\\n  We might have come out with force upon you\\n and havecaused you to feel the dint of our swords\\n but as we loveease and quiet ourselves\\n so we love not to hurt or molestothers\\n\\'Then did the town of Mansoul shout for joy\\n as if by Diabolusand his crew some great advantage had been gotten of thecaptains\\n  They also rang the bells\\n and made merry\\n anddanced upon the walls\\nDiabolus also returned to the castle\\n and the Lord Mayor andRecorder to their place\\n but the Lord Willbewill took specialcare that the gates should be secured with double guards\\ndouble bolts\\n and double locks and bars\\n and that Ear-gateespecially might the better be looked to\\n for that was thegate in at which the King\\'s forces sought most to enter\\n  TheLord Willbewill made one old Mr\\n Prejudice\\n an angry and ill-conditioned fellow\\n captain of the ward at that gate\\n and putunder his power sixty men\\n called deaf men\\n men advantageousfor that service\\n forasmuch as they mattered no words of thecaptains\\n nor of the soldiers\\nNow when the captains saw the answer of the great ones\\n andthat they could not get a hearing from the old natives of thetown\\n and that Mansoul was resolved to give the King\\'s armybattle\\n they prepared themselves to receive them\\n and to tryit out by the power of the arm\\n  And\\n first\\n they made theirforce more formidable against Ear-gate\\n for they knew that\\nunless they could penetrate that\\n no good could be done uponthe town\\n  This done\\n they put the rest of their men in theirplaces\\n after which\\n they gave out the word\\n which was\\n \\'YEMUST BE BORN AGAIN\\n\\'  Then they sounded the trumpet\\n thenthey in the town made them answer\\n with shout against shout\\ncharge against charge\\n and so the battle began\\n  Now they inthe town had planted upon the tower over Ear-gate two greatguns\\n the one called High-mind\\n and the other Heady\\n  Untothese two guns they trusted much\\n they were cast in thecastle by Diabolus\\' founder\\n whose name was Mr\\n Puff-up\\n andmischievous pieces they were\\n  But so vigilant and watchful\\nwhen the captains saw them\\n were they\\n that though sometimestheir shot would go by their ears with a whiz\\n yet they didthem no harm\\n  By these two guns the townsfolk made noquestion but greatly to annoy the camp of Shaddai\\n and wellenough to secure the gate\\n but they had not much cause toboast of what execution they did\\n as by what follows will begathered\\nThe famous Mansoul had also some other small pieces in it\\n ofthe which they made use against the camp of Shaddai\\nThey from the camp also did as stoutly\\n and with as much ofthat as may in truth be called valour\\n let fly as fast at thetown and at Ear-gate\\n for they saw that\\n unless they couldbreak open Ear-gate\\n it would be but in vain to batter thewall\\n  Now the King\\'s captains had brought with them severalslings\\n and two or three battering-rams\\n with their slings\\ntherefore\\n they battered the houses and people of the town\\nand with their rams they sought to break Ear-gate open\\nThe camp and the town had several skirmishes and briskencounters\\n while the captains with their engines made manybrave attempts to break open or beat down the tower that wasover Ear-gate\\n and at the said gate to make their entrance\\nbut Mansoul stood it out so lustily\\n through the rage ofDiabolus\\n the valour of the Lord Willbewill\\n and the conductof old Incredulity\\n the Mayor\\n and Mr\\n Forget-Good\\n theRecorder\\n that the charge and expense of that summer\\'s wars\\non the King\\'s side\\n seemed to be almost quite lost\\n and theadvantage to return to Mansoul\\n  But when the captains sawhow it was they made a fair retreat\\n and entrenchedthemselves in their winter quarters\\n  Now\\n in this war\\n youmust needs think there was much loss on both sides\\n of whichbe pleased to accept of this brief account following\\nThe King\\'s captains\\n when they marched from the court to comeup against Mansoul to war\\n as they came crossing over thecountry\\n they happened to light upon three young fellows thathad a mind to go for soldiers\\n proper men they were\\n and menof courage and skill\\n to appearance\\n  Their names were Mr\\nTradition\\n Mr\\n Human-Wisdom\\n and Mr\\n Man\\'s-Invention\\n  Sothey came up to the captains\\n and proffered their service toShaddai\\n  The captains then told them of their design\\n andbid them not to be rash in their offers\\n but the young mentold them they had considered the thing before\\n and thathearing they were upon their march for such a design\\n camehither on purpose to meet them\\n that they might be listedunder their excellencies\\n  Then Captain Boanerges\\n for thatthey were men of courage\\n listed them into his company\\n andso away they went to the war\\nNow\\n when the war was begun\\n in one of the briskestskirmishes\\n so it was\\n that a company of the LordWillbewill\\'s men sallied out at the sallyport or postern ofthe town\\n and fell in upon the rear of Captain Boanerges\\'men\\n where these three fellows happened to be\\n so they tookthem prisoners\\n and away they carried them into the town\\nwhere they had not lain long in durance\\n but it began to benoised about the streets of the town what three notableprisoners the Lord Willbewill\\'s men had taken\\n and brought inprisoners out of the camp of Shaddai\\n  At length tidingsthereof were carried to Diabolus to the castle\\n to wit whatmy Lord Willbewill\\'s men had done\\n and whom they had takenprisoners\\nThen Diabolus called for Willbewill\\n to know the certainty ofthis matter\\n  So he asked him\\n and he told him\\n  Then did thegiant send for the prisoners\\n and\\n when they were come\\ndemanded of them who they were\\n whence they came\\n and whatthey did in the camp of Shaddai\\n and they told him\\n  Then hesent them to ward again\\n  Not many days after\\n he sent forthem to him again\\n and then asked them if they would bewilling to serve him against their former captains\\n  Theythen told him that they did not so much live by religion asby the fates of fortune\\n and that since his lordship waswilling to entertain them\\n they should be willing to servehim\\n  Now while things were thus in hand\\n there was oneCaptain Anything\\n a great doer\\n in the town of Mansoul\\n andto this Captain Anything did Diabolus send these men\\n and anote under his hand\\n to receive them into his company\\n thecontents of which letter were thus\\n\\'Anything\\n my darling\\n - The three men that are the bearersof this letter have a desire to serve me in the war\\n nor knowI better to whose conduct to commit them than to thine\\nReceive them\\n therefore\\n in my name\\n and\\n as need shallrequire\\n make use of them against Shaddai and his men\\nFarewell\\n\\'So they came\\n and he received them\\n and he made of two ofthem sergeants\\n but he made Mr\\n Man\\'s-Invention his ancient-bearer\\n  But thus much for this\\n and now to return to thecamp\\nThey of the camp did also some execution upon the town\\n forthey did beat down the roof of the Lord Mayor\\'s house\\n and solaid him more open than he was before\\n  They had almost\\n witha sling\\n slain my Lord Willbewill outright\\n but he made ashift to recover again\\n  But they made a notable slaughteramong the aldermen\\n for with one only shot they cut off sixof them\\n to wit\\n Mr\\n Swearing\\n Mr\\n Whoring\\n Mr\\n Fury\\n Mr\\nStand-to-Lies\\n Mr\\n Drunkenness\\n and Mr\\n Cheating\\nThey also dismounted the two guns that stood upon the towerover Ear-gate\\n and laid them flat in the dirt\\n  I told youbefore that the King\\'s noble captains had drawn off to theirwinter quarters\\n and had there entrenched themselves andtheir carriages\\n so as with the best advantage to their King\\nand the greatest annoyance to the enemy\\n they might giveseasonable and warm alarms to the town of Mansoul\\n  And thisdesign of them did so hit\\n that I may say they did almostwhat they would to the molestation of the corporation\\n  Fornow could not Mansoul sleep securely as before\\n nor couldthey now go to their debaucheries with that quietness as intimes past\\n for they had from the camp of Shaddai suchfrequent\\n warm\\n and terrifying alarms\\n yea\\n alarms uponalarms\\n first at one gate and then at another\\n and again atall the gates at once\\n that they were broken as to formerpeace\\n  Yea\\n they had their alarms so frequently\\n and thatwhen the nights were at longest\\n the weather coldest\\n and soconsequently the season most unseasonable\\n that that winterwas to the town of Mansoul a winter by itself\\n  Sometimes thetrumpets would sound\\n and sometimes the slings would whirlthe stones into the town\\n  Sometimes ten thousand of theKing\\'s soldiers would be running round the walls of Mansoulat midnight\\n shouting and lifting up the voice for thebattle\\n  Sometimes\\n again\\n some of them in the town would bewounded\\n and their cry and lamentable voice would be heard\\nto the great molestation of the now languishing town ofMansoul\\n  Yea\\n so distressed with those that laid siegeagainst them were they\\n that\\n I dare say\\n Diabolus\\n theirking\\n had in these days his rest much broken\\nIn these days\\n as I was informed\\n new thoughts\\n and thoughtsthat began to run counter one to another\\n began to possessthe minds of the men of the town of Mansoul\\n  Some would say\\n\\'There is no living thus\\n\\'  Others would then reply\\n \\'Thiswill be over shortly\\n\\'  Then would a third stand up andanswer\\n \\'Let us turn to the King Shaddai\\n and so put an endto these troubles\\n\\'  And a fourth would come in with a fear\\nsaying\\n \\'I doubt he will not receive us\\n\\'  The old gentleman\\ntoo\\n the Recorder\\n that was so before Diabolus took Mansoul\\nhe also began to talk aloud\\n and his words were now to thetown of Mansoul as if they were great claps of thunder\\n  Nonoise now so terrible to Mansoul as was his\\n with the noiseof the soldiers and shoutings of the captains\\nAlso things began to grow scarce in Mansoul\\n now the thingsthat her soul lusted after were departing from her\\n  Upon allher pleasant things there was a blast\\n and burning instead ofbeauty\\n  Wrinkles now\\n and some shows of the shadow of death\\nwere upon the inhabitants of Mansoul\\n  And now\\n O how gladwould Mansoul have been to have enjoyed quietness andsatisfaction of mind\\n though joined with the meanestcondition in the world\\nThe captains also\\n in the deep of this winter\\n did send bythe mouth of Boanerges\\' trumpeter a summons to Mansoul toyield up herself to the King\\n the great King Shaddai\\n  Theysent it once\\n and twice\\n and thrice\\n not knowing but that atsome times there might be in Mansoul some willingness tosurrender up themselves unto them\\n might they but have thecolour of an invitation to do it under\\n  Yea\\n so far as Icould gather\\n the town had been surrendered up to them beforenow\\n had it not been for the opposition of old Incredulity\\nand the fickleness of the thoughts of my Lord Willbewill\\nDiabolus also began to rave\\n wherefore Mansoul\\n as toyielding\\n was not yet all of one mind\\n therefore they stilllay distressed under these perplexing fears\\nI told you but now that they of the King\\'s army had thiswinter sent three times to Mansoul to submit herself\\nThe first time the trumpeter went he went with words ofpeace\\n telling them that the captains\\n the noble captains ofShaddai\\n did pity and bewail the misery of the now perishingtown of Mansoul\\n and were troubled to see them so much tostand in the way of their own deliverance\\n  He said\\nmoreover\\n that the captains bid him tell them\\n that if nowpoor Mansoul would humble herself and turn\\n her formerrebellions and most notorious treasons should by theirmerciful King be forgiven them\\n yea\\n and forgotten too\\n  Andhaving bid them beware that they stood not in their own way\\nthat they opposed not themselves\\n nor made themselves theirown losers\\n he returned again into the camp\\nThe second time the trumpeter went\\n he did treat them alittle more roughly\\n for\\n after sound of trumpet\\n he toldthem that their continuing in their rebellion did but chafeand heat the spirit of the captains\\n and that they wereresolved to make a conquest of Mansoul\\n or to lay their bonesbefore the town walls\\nHe went again the third time\\n and dealt with them yet moreroughly\\n telling them that now\\n since they had been sohorribly profane\\n he did not know\\n not certainly know\\nwhether the captains were inclining to mercy or judgment\\n\\'Only\\n\\' said he\\n \\'they commanded me to give you a summons toopen the gates unto them\\n\\'  So he returned\\n and went into thecamp\\nThese three summonses\\n and especially the last two\\n did sodistress the town that they presently call a consultation\\nthe result of which was this - That my Lord Willbewill shouldgo up to Ear-gate\\n and there\\n with sound of trumpet\\n call tothe captains of the camp for a parley\\n  Well\\n the LordWillbewill sounded upon the wall\\n so the captains came up intheir harness\\n with their ten thousands at their feet\\n  Thetownsmen then told the captains that they had heard andconsidered their summons\\n and would come to an agreement withthem\\n and with their King Shaddai\\n upon such certain terms\\narticles\\n and propositions as\\n with and by the order of theirprince\\n they to them were appointed to propound\\n to wit\\n theywould agree upon these grounds to be one people with them\\n1\\n If that those of their own company\\n as the now Lord Mayorand their Mr\\n Forget-Good\\n with then brave Lord Willbewill\\nmight\\n under Shaddai\\n be still the governors of the town\\ncastle\\n and gates of Mansoul\\n2\\n Provided that no man that now serveth under their greatgiant Diabolus be by Shaddai cast out of house\\n harbour\\n orthe freedom that he hath hitherto enjoyed in the famous townof Mansoul\\n3\\n That it shall be granted them\\n that they of the town ofMansoul shall enjoy certain of their rights and privileges\\nto wit\\n such as have formerly been granted them\\n and thatthey have long lived in the enjoyment of\\n under the reign oftheir king Diabolus\\n that now is\\n and long has been\\n theironly lord and great defender\\n4\\n That no new law\\n officer\\n or executioner of law or office\\nshall have any power over them\\n without their own choice andconsent\\n\\'These be our propositions\\n or conditions of peace\\n and uponthese terms\\n\\' said they\\n \\'we will submit to your King\\n\\'But when the captains had heard this weak and feeble offer ofthe town of Mansoul\\n and their high and bold demands\\n theymade to them again\\n by their noble captain\\n the CaptainBoanerges\\n this speech following\\n\\'O ye inhabitants of the town of Mansoul\\n when I heard yourtrumpet sound for a parley with us\\n I can truly say I wasglad\\n but when you said you were willing to submit yourselvesto our King and Lord\\n then I was yet more glad\\n but when\\n byyour silly provisos and foolish cavils\\n you laid thestumbling-block of your iniquity before your own faces\\n thenwas my gladness turned into sorrows\\n and my hopefulbeginnings of your return\\n into languishing fainting fears\\n\\'I count that old Ill-Pause\\n the ancient enemy of Mansoul\\ndid draw up those proposals that now you present us with asterms of an agreement\\n but they deserve not to be admitted tosound in the ear of any man that pretends to have service forShaddai\\n  We do therefore jointly\\n and that with the highestdisdain\\n refuse and reject such things\\n as the greatest ofiniquities\\n\\'But\\n O Mansoul\\n if you will give yourselves into our hands\\nor rather into the hands of our King\\n and will trust him tomake such terms with and for you as shall seem good in hiseyes\\n (and I dare say they shall be such as you shall find tobe most profitable to you\\n) then we will receive you\\n and beat peace with you\\n but if you like not to trust yourselves inthe arms of Shaddai our King\\n then things are but where theywere before\\n and we know also what we have to do\\n\\'Then cried out old Incredulity\\n the Lord Mayor\\n and said\\n\\'And who\\n being out of the hands of their enemies\\n as ye seewe are now\\n will be so foolish as to put the staff out oftheir own hands into the hands of they know not who\\n  I\\n formy part\\n will never yield to so unlimited a proposition\\n  Dowe know the manner and temper of their King\\n  It is said bysome that he will be angry with his subjects if but thebreadth of an hair they chance to step out of the way\\n and byothers\\n that he requireth of them much more than they canperform\\n  Wherefore\\n it seems\\n O Mansoul\\n to be thy wisdom totake good heed what thou dost in this matter\\n for if you onceyield\\n you give up yourselves to another\\n and so you are nomore your own\\n  Wherefore\\n to give up yourselves to anunlimited power\\n is the greatest folly in the world\\n for nowyou indeed may repent\\n but can never justly complain\\n  But doyou indeed know\\n when you are his\\n which of you he will kill\\nand which of you he will save alive\\n or whether he will notcut off every one of us\\n and send out of his own countryanother new people\\n and cause them to inhabit this town\\n\\'This speech of the Lord Mayor undid all\\n and threw flat tothe ground their hopes of an accord\\n  Wherefore the captainsreturned to their trenches\\n to their tents\\n and to their men\\nas they were\\n and the Mayor to the castle and to his King\\nNow Diabolus had waited for his return\\n for he had heard thatthey had been at their points\\n  So\\n when he was come into thechamber of state\\n Diabolus saluted him with - \\'Welcome\\n mylord\\n  How went matters betwixt you to-day\\n\\'  So the LordIncredulity\\n with a low congee\\n told him the whole of thematter\\n saying\\n \\'Thus and thus said the captains of Shaddai\\nand thus and thus said I\\n\\'  The which when it was told toDiabolus\\n he was very glad to hear it\\n and said\\n \\'My LordMayor\\n my faithful Incredulity\\n I have proved thy fidelityabove ten times already\\n but never yet found thee false\\n  Ido promise thee\\n if we rub over this brunt\\n to prefer thee toa place of honour\\n a place far better than to be Lord Mayorof Mansoul\\n  I will make thee my universal deputy\\n and thoushalt\\n next to me\\n have all nations under thy hand\\n yea\\n andthou shalt lay bands upon them\\n that they may not resistthee\\n nor shall any of our vassals walk more at liberty\\n butthose that shall be content to walk in thy fetters\\n\\'Now came the Lord Mayor out from Diabolus\\n as if he hadobtained a favour indeed\\n  Wherefore to his habitation hegoes in great state\\n and thinks to feed himself well enoughwith hopes\\n until the time came that his greatness should beenlarged\\nBut now\\n though the Lord Mayor and Diabolus did thus wellagree\\n yet this repulse to the brave captains put Mansoulinto a mutiny\\n  For while old Incredulity went into thecastle to congratulate his lord with what had passed\\n the oldLord Mayor\\n that was so before Diabolus came to the town\\n towit\\n my Lord Understanding\\n and the old Recorder\\n Mr\\nConscience\\n getting intelligence of what had passed at Ear-gate\\n (for you must know that they might not be suffered tobe at that debate\\n lest they should then have mutinied forthe captains\\n but\\n I say\\n they got intelligence of what hadpassed there\\n and were much concerned therewith\\n) whereforethey\\n getting some of the town together\\n began to possessthem with the reasonableness of the noble captains\\' demands\\nand with the bad consequences that would follow upon thespeech of old Incredulity\\n the Lord Mayor\\n to wit how littlereverence he showed therein either to the captains or totheir King\\n also how he implicitly charged them withunfaithfulness and treachery\\n  \\'For what less\\n\\' quoth they\\n\\'could be made of his words\\n when he said he would not yieldto their proposition\\n and added\\n moreover\\n a supposition thathe would destroy us\\n when before he had sent us word that hewould show us mercy\\n\\'  The multitude\\n being now possessedwith the conviction of the evil that old Incredulity haddone\\n began to run together by companies in all places\\n andin every corner of the streets of Mansoul\\n and first theybegan to mutter\\n then to talk openly\\n and after that they runto and fro\\n and cried as they run\\n \\'Oh the brave captains ofShaddai\\n would we were under the government of the captains\\nand of Shaddai their King\\n\\'  When the Lord Mayor hadintelligence that Mansoul was in an uproar\\n down he comes toappease the people\\n and thought to have quashed their heatwith the bigness and the show of his countenance\\n but whenthey saw him\\n they came running upon him\\n and had doubtlessdone him a mischief\\n had he not betaken himself to house\\nHowever\\n they strongly assaulted the house where he was\\n tohave pulled it down about his ears\\n but the place was toostrong\\n so they failed of that\\n  So he\\n taking some courage\\naddressed himself\\n out at a window\\n to the people in thismanner\\n\\'Gentlemen\\n what is the reason that there is here such anuproar to-day\\n\\'Then answered my Lord Understanding\\n \\'It is even because thatthou and thy master have carried it not rightly\\n and as youshould\\n to the captains of Shaddai\\n for in three things youare faulty\\n  First\\n in that you would not let Mr\\n Conscienceand myself be at the hearing of your discourse\\n  Secondly\\n inthat you propounded such terms of peace to the captains thatby no means could be granted\\n unless they had intended thattheir Shaddai should have been only a titular prince\\n andthat Mansoul should still have had power by law to have livedin all lewdness and vanity before him\\n and so by consequenceDiabolus should still here be king in power\\n and the otheronly king in name\\n  Thirdly\\n for that thou didst thyself\\nafter the captains had showed us upon what conditions theywould have received us to mercy\\n even undo all again with thyunsavoury\\n unseasonable\\n and ungodly speech\\n\\'When old Incredulity had heard this speech\\n he cried out\\n\\'Treason\\n treason\\n  To your arms\\n to your arms\\n  O ye\\n thetrusty friends of Diabolus in Mansoul\\n\\'UND\\n - Sir\\n you may put upon my words what meaning youplease\\n but I am sure that the captains of such an high lordas theirs is\\n deserved a better treatment at your hands\\nThen said old Incredulity\\n \\'This is but little better\\n  But\\nSir\\n\\' quoth he\\n \\'what I spake I spake for my prince\\n for hisgovernment\\n and the quieting of the people\\n whom by yourunlawful actions you have this day set to mutiny against us\\n\\'Then replied the old Recorder\\n whose name was Mr\\n Conscience\\nand said\\n \\'Sir\\n you ought not thus to retort upon what myLord Understanding hath said\\n  It is evident enough that hehath spoken the truth\\n and that you are an enemy to Mansoul\\nBe convinced\\n then\\n of the evil of your saucy and malapertlanguage\\n and of the grief that you have put the captains to\\nyea\\n and of the damages that you have done to Mansoulthereby\\n  Had you accepted of the conditions\\n the sound ofthe trumpet and the alarm of war had now ceased about thetown of Mansoul\\n but that dreadful sound abides\\n and yourwant of wisdom in your speech has been the cause of it\\n\\'Then said old Incredulity\\n \\'Sir\\n if I live\\n I will do yourerrand to Diabolus\\n and there you shall have an answer toyour words\\n  Meanwhile we will seek the good of the town\\n andnot ask counsel of you\\n\\'UND\\n - Sir\\n your prince and you are both foreigners toMansoul\\n and not the natives thereof\\n and who can tell butthat\\n when you have brought us into greater straits\\n (whenyou also shall see that yourselves can be safe by no othermeans than by flight\\n) you may leave us and shift foryourselves\\n or set us on fire\\n and go away in the smoke\\n orby the light of our burning\\n and so leave us in our ruins\\nINCRED\\n - Sir\\n you forget that you are under a governor\\n andthat you ought to demean yourself like a subject\\n and knowye\\n when my lord the king shall hear of this day\\'s work\\n hewill give you but little thanks for your labour\\nNow while these gentlemen were thus in their chiding words\\ndown come from the walls and gates of the town the LordWillbewill\\n Mr\\n Prejudice\\n old Ill-Pause\\n and several of thenew-made aldermen and burgesses\\n and they asked the reason ofthe hubbub and tumult\\n and with that every man began to tellhis own tale\\n so that nothing could be heard distinctly\\nThen was a silence commanded\\n and the old fox Incredulitybegan to speak\\n  \\'My lord\\n\\' quoth he\\n \\'here are a couple ofpeevish gentlemen\\n that have\\n as a fruit of their baddispositions\\n and\\n as I fear\\n through the advice of one Mr\\nDiscontent\\n tumultuously gathered this company against methis day\\n and also attempted to run the town into acts ofrebellion against our prince\\n\\'Then stood up all the Diabolonians that were present\\n andaffirmed these things to be true\\nNow when they that took part with my Lord Understanding andwith Mr\\n Conscience perceived that they were like to come tothe worst\\n for that force and power was on the other side\\nthey came in for their help and relief\\n so a great companywas on both sides\\n  Then they on Incredulity\\'s side wouldhave had the two old gentlemen presently away to prison\\n butthey on the other side said they should not\\n  Then they beganto cry up parties again\\n the Diabolonians cried up oldIncredulity\\n Forget-Good\\n the new aldermen\\n and their greatone Diabolus\\n and the other party\\n they as fast cried upShaddai\\n the captains\\n his laws\\n their mercifulness\\n andapplauded their conditions and ways\\n  Thus the bickermentwent awhile\\n at last they passed from words to blows\\n and nowthere were knocks on both sides\\n  The good old gentleman\\n Mr\\nConscience\\n was knocked down twice by one of theDiabolonians\\n whose name was Mr\\n Benumbing\\n and my LordUnderstanding had like to have been slain with an arquebuse\\nbut that he that shot did not take his aim aright\\n  Nor didthe other side wholly escape\\n for there was one Mr\\n Rashhead\\na Diabolonian\\n that had his brains beaten out by Mr\\n Mind\\nthe Lord Willbewill\\'s servant\\n and it made me laugh to seehow old Mr\\n Prejudice was kicked and tumbled about in thedirt\\n for though\\n a while since\\n he was made captain of acompany of the Diabolonians\\n to the hurt and damage of thetown\\n yet now they had got him under their feet\\n and\\n I\\'llassure you\\n he had\\n by some of the Lord Understanding\\'sparty\\n his crown cracked to boot\\n  Mr\\n Anything also\\n hebecame a brisk man in the broil\\n but both sides were againsthim\\n because he was true to none\\n  Yet he had\\n for hismalapertness\\n one of his legs broken\\n and he that did itwished it had been his neck\\n  Much more harm was done on bothsides\\n but this must not be forgotten\\n it was now a wonder tosee my Lord Willbewill so indifferent as he was\\n he did notseem to take one side more than another\\n only it wasperceived that he smiled to see how old Prejudice was tumbledup and down in the dirt\\n  Also\\n when Captain Anything camehalting up before him\\n he seemed to take but little notice ofhim\\nNow\\n when the uproar was over\\n Diabolus sends for my LordUnderstanding and Mr\\n Conscience\\n and claps them both up inprison as the ringleaders and managers of this most heavy\\nriotous rout in Mansoul\\n  So now the town began to be quietagain\\n and the prisoners were used hardly\\n yea\\n he thought tohave made them away\\n but that the present juncture did notserve for that purpose\\n for that war was in all their gates\\nBut let us return again to our story\\n  The captains\\n whenthey were gone back from the gate\\n and were come into thecamp again\\n called a council of war\\n to consult what wasfurther for them to do\\n  Now\\n some said\\n \\'Let us go uppresently\\n and fall upon the town\\n\\' but the greatest partthought rather better it would be to give them anothersummons to yield\\n and the reason why they thought this to bebest was\\n because that\\n so far as could be perceived\\n thetown of Mansoul now was more inclinable than heretofore\\n\\'And if\\n\\' said they\\n \\'while some of them are in a way ofinclination\\n we should by ruggedness give them distaste\\n wemay set them further from closing with our summons than wewould be willing they should\\n\\'  Wherefore to this advice theyagreed\\n and called a trumpeter\\n put words into his mouth\\n sethim his time\\n and bid him God speed\\n  Well\\n many hours werenot expired before the trumpeter addressed himself to hisjourney\\n  Wherefore\\n coming up to the wall of the town\\n hesteereth his course to Ear-gate\\n and there sounded\\n as he wascommanded\\n  They then that were within came out to see whatwas the matter\\n and the trumpeter made them this speechfollowing\\n\\'O hard-hearted and deplorable town of Mansoul\\n how long wiltthou love thy sinful\\n sinful simplicity\\n and\\n ye fools\\ndelight in your scorning\\n  As yet despise you the offers ofpeace and deliverance\\n  As yet will ye refuse the goldenoffers of Shaddai\\n and trust to the lies and falsehoods ofDiabolus\\n  Think you\\n when Shaddai shall have conquered you\\nthat the remembrance of these your carriages towards him willyield you peace and comfort\\n or that by ruffling language youcan make him afraid as a grasshopper\\n  Doth he entreat youfor fear of you\\n  Do you think that you are stronger than he\\nLook to the heavens\\n and behold and consider the stars\\n howhigh are they\\n  Can you stop the sun from running his course\\nand hinder the moon from giving her light\\n  Can you count thenumber of the stars\\n or stay the bottles of heaven\\n  Can youcall for the waters of the sea\\n and cause them to cover theface of the ground\\n  Can you behold every one that is proud\\nand abase him\\n and bind their faces in secret\\n  Yet these aresome of the works of our King\\n in whose name this day we comeup unto you\\n that you may be brought under his authority\\n  Inhis name\\n therefore\\n I summon you again to yield upyourselves to his captains\\n\\'At this summons the Mansoulians seemed to be at a stand\\n andknew not what answer to make\\n  Wherefore Diabolus forthwithappeared\\n and took upon him to do it himself\\n and thus hebegins\\n but turns his speech to them of Mansoul\\n\\'Gentlemen\\n\\' quoth he\\n \\'and my faithful subjects\\n if it istrue that this summoner hath said concerning the greatness oftheir King\\n by his terror you will always be kept in bondage\\nand so be made to sneak\\n  Yea\\n how can you now\\n though he isat a distance\\n endure to think of such a mighty one\\n  And ifnot to think of him while at a distance\\n how can you endureto be in his presence\\n  I\\n your prince\\n am familiar with you\\nand you may play with me as you would with a grasshopper\\nConsider\\n therefore\\n what is for your profit\\n and rememberthe immunities that I have granted you\\n\\'Farther\\n if all be true that this man hath said\\n how comesit to pass that the subjects of Shaddai are so enslaved inall places where they come\\n  None in the universe so unhappyas they\\n none so trampled upon as they\\n\\'Consider\\n my Mansoul\\n would thou wert as loath to leave meas I am loath to leave thee\\n  But consider\\n I say\\n the ballis yet at thy foot\\n liberty you have\\n if you know how to useit\\n yea\\n a king you have too\\n if you can tell how to love andobey him\\n\\'Upon this speech\\n the town of Mansoul did again harden theirhearts yet more against the captains of Shaddai\\n  Thethoughts of his greatness did quite quash them\\n and thethoughts of his holiness sunk them in despair\\n  Wherefore\\nafter a short consult\\n they (of the Diabolonian party theywere) sent back this word by the trumpeter\\n That\\n for theirparts\\n they were resolved to stick to their king\\n but neverto yield to Shaddai\\n so it was but in vain to give them anyfurther summons\\n for they had rather die upon the place thanyield\\n  And now things seemed to be gone quite back\\n andMansoul to be out of reach or call\\n yet the captains who knewwhat their Lord could do\\n would not yet be beat out of heart\\nthey therefore sent them another summons\\n more sharp andsevere than the last\\n but the oftener they were sent to\\n toreconcile to Shaddai\\n the further off they were\\n  \\'As theycalled them\\n so they went from them - yea\\n though they calledthem to the Most High\\n\\'So they ceased that way to deal with them any more\\n andinclined to think of another way\\n  The captains\\n therefore\\ndid gather themselves together\\n to have free conference amongthemselves\\n to know what was yet to be done to gain the town\\nand to deliver it from the tyranny of Diabolus\\n and one saidafter this manner\\n and another after that\\n  Then stood up theright noble the Captain Conviction\\n and said\\n \\'My brethren\\nmine opinion is this\\n\\'First\\n that we continually play our slings into the town\\nand keep it in a continual alarm\\n molesting them day andnight\\n  By thus doing\\n we shall stop the growth of theirrampant spirit\\n for a lion may be tamed by continualmolestation\\n\\'Secondly\\n this done\\n I advise that\\n in the next place\\n wewith one consent draw up a petition to our Lord Shaddai\\n bywhich\\n after we have showed our King the condition of Mansouland of affairs here\\n and have begged his pardon for our nobetter success\\n we will earnestly implore his Majesty\\'s help\\nand that he will please to send us more force and power\\n andsome gallant and well-spoken commander to head them\\n that sohis Majesty may not lose the benefit of these his goodbeginnings\\n but may complete his conquest upon the town ofMansoul\\n\\'To this speech of the noble Captain Conviction they as oneman consented\\n and agreed that a petition should forthwith bedrawn up\\n and sent by a fit man away to Shaddai with speed\\nThe contents of the petition were thus\\n-\\'Most gracious and glorious King\\n the Lord of the best world\\nand the builder of the town of Mansoul\\n we have\\n dreadSovereign\\n at thy commandment\\n put our lives in jeopardy\\n andat thy bidding made a war upon the famous town of Mansoul\\nWhen we went up against it\\n we did\\n according to ourcommission\\n first offer conditions of peace unto it\\n  Butthey\\n great King\\n set light by our counsel\\n and would none ofour reproof\\n  They were for shutting their gates\\n and forkeeping us out of the town\\n  They also mounted their guns\\nthey sallied out upon us\\n and have done us what damage theycould\\n but we pursued them with alarm upon alarm\\n requitingthem with such retribution as was meet\\n and have done someexecution upon the town\\n\\'Diabolus\\n Incredulity\\n and Willbewill are the great doersagainst us\\n now we are in our winter quarters\\n but so as thatwe do yet with an high hand molest and distress the town\\n\\'Once\\n as we think\\n had we had but one substantial friend inthe town\\n such as would but have seconded the sound of oursummons as they ought\\n the people might have yieldedthemselves\\n but there were none but enemies there\\n nor any tospeak in behalf of our Lord to the town\\n  Wherefore\\n thoughwe have done as we could\\n yet Mansoul abides in a state ofrebellion against thee\\n\\'Now\\n King of kings\\n let it please thee to pardon theunsuccessfulness of thy servants\\n who have been no moreadvantageous in so desirable a work as the conquering ofMansoul is\\n  And send\\n Lord\\n as we now desire\\n more forces toMansoul\\n that it may be subdued\\n and a man to head them\\n thatthe town may both love and fear\\n\\'We do not thus speak because we are willing to relinquishthe wars\\n (for we are for laying of our bones against theplace\\n) but that the town of Mansoul may be won for thyMajesty\\n  We also pray thy Majesty\\n for expedition in thismatter\\n that\\n after their conquest\\n we may be at liberty tobe sent about other thy gracious designs\\n  Amen\\n\\'The petition\\n thus drawn up\\n was sent away with haste to theKing by the hand of that good man\\n Mr\\n Love-to-Mansoul\\nWhen this petition was come to the palace of the King\\n whoshould it be delivered to but to the King\\'s Son\\n  So he tookit and read it\\n and because the contents of it pleased himwell\\n he mended\\n and also in some things added to thepetition himself\\n  So\\n after he had made such amendments andadditions as he thought convenient\\n with his own hand\\n hecarried it in to the King\\n to whom\\n when he had withobeisance delivered it\\n he put on authority\\n and spake to ithimself\\nNow the King\\n at the sight of the petition\\n was glad\\n but howmuch more\\n think you\\n when it was seconded by his Son\\n  Itpleased him also to hear that his servants who camped againstMansoul were so hearty in the work\\n and so steadfast in theirresolves\\n and that they had already got some ground upon thefamous town of Mansoul\\nWherefore the King called to him Emmanuel\\n his Son\\n who said\\n\\'Here am I\\n my Father\\n\\'  Then said the King\\n \\'Thou knowest\\nas I do myself\\n the condition of the town of Mansoul\\n andwhat we have purposed\\n and what thou hast done to redeem it\\nCome now\\n therefore\\n my Son\\n and prepare thyself for the war\\nfor thou shalt go to my camp at Mansoul\\n  Thou shalt alsothere prosper and prevail\\n and conquer the town of Mansoul\\n\\'Then said the King\\'s Son\\n \\'Thy law is within my heart\\n Idelight to do thy will\\n  This is the day that I have longedfor\\n and the work that I have waited for all this while\\nGrant me\\n therefore\\n what force thou shalt in thy wisdomthink meet\\n and I will go and will deliver from Diabolus\\n andfrom his power\\n thy perishing town of Mansoul\\n  My heart hasbeen often pained within me for the miserable town ofMansoul\\n but now it is rejoiced\\n but now it is glad\\n\\'And with that he leaped over the mountains for joy\\n saying\\n\\'I have not\\n in my heart\\n thought anything too dear forMansoul\\n the day of vengeance is in mine heart for thee\\n myMansoul\\n and glad am I that thou\\n my Father\\n hast made me theCaptain of their salvation\\n  And I will now begin to plagueall those that have been a plague to my town of Mansoul\\n andwill deliver it from their hand\\n\\'When the King\\'s Son had said thus to his Father\\n it presentlyflew like lightning round about at court\\n yea\\n it therebecame the only talk what Emmanuel was to go to do for thefamous town of Mansoul\\n  But you cannot think how thecourtiers\\n too\\n were taken with this design of the Prince\\nyea\\n so affected were they with this work\\n and with thejustness of the war\\n that the highest lord and greatest peerof the kingdom did covet to have commissions under Emmanuel\\nto go to help to recover again to Shaddai the miserable townof Mansoul\\nThen was it concluded that some should go and carry tidingsto the camp\\n that Emmanuel was to come to recover Mansoul\\nand that he would bring along with him so mighty\\n soimpregnable a force\\n that he could not be resisted\\n  But\\n oh\\nhow ready were the high ones at court to run like lackeys tocarry these tidings to the camp that was at Mansoul\\n  Now\\nwhen the captains perceived that the King would send Emmanuelhis Son\\n and that it also delighted the Son to be sent onthis errand by the great Shaddai his Father\\n they also\\n toshow how they were pleased at the thoughts of his coming gavea shout that made the earth rend at the sound thereof\\n  Yea\\nthe mountains did answer again by echo\\n and Diabolus himselfdid totter and shake\\nFor you must know\\n that though the town of Mansoul itself wasnot much\\n if at all concerned with the project\\n (for\\n alasfor them\\n they were wofully besotted\\n for they chieflyregarded their pleasure and their lusts\\n) yet Diabolus theirgovernor was\\n for he had his spies continually abroad\\n whobrought him intelligence of all things\\n and they told himwhat was doing at court against him\\n and that Emmanuel wouldshortly certainly come with a power to invade him\\n  Nor wasthere any man at court\\n nor peer of the kingdom\\n thatDiabolus so feared as he feared this Prince\\n for\\n if youremember\\n I showed you before that Diabolus had felt theweight of his hand already\\n so that\\n since it was he that wasto come\\n this made him the more afraid\\nWell\\n you see how I have told you that the King\\'s Son wasengaged to come from the court to save Mansoul\\n and that hisFather had made him the Captain of the forces\\n  The time\\ntherefore\\n of his setting forth being now expired\\n headdressed himself for his march\\n and taketh with him\\n for hispower\\n five noble captains and their forces\\n1\\n The first was that famous captain\\n the noble CaptainCredence\\n  His were the red colours\\n and Mr\\n Promise barethem\\n and for a scutcheon he had the holy lamb and goldenshield\\n and he had ten thousand men at his feet\\n2\\n The second was that famous captain\\n the Captain Good-Hope\\nHis were the blue colours\\n his standard-bearer was Mr\\nExpectation\\n and for his scutcheon he had the three goldenanchors\\n and he had ten thousand men at his feet\\n3\\n The third was that valiant captain\\n the Captain Charity\\nHis standard-bearer was Mr\\n Pitiful\\n his were the greencolours\\n and for his scutcheon he had three naked orphansembraced in the bosom\\n and he had ten thousand men at hisfeet\\n4\\n The fourth was that gallant commander\\n the CaptainInnocent\\n  His standard-bearer was Mr\\n Harmless\\n his were thewhite colours\\n and for his scutcheon he had the three goldendoves\\n5\\n The fifth was the truly loyal and well-beloved captain\\nthe Captain Patience\\n  His standard-bearer was Mr\\n Suffer-Long\\n his were the black colours\\n and for a scutcheon he hadthree arrows through the golden heart\\nThese were Emmanuel\\'s captains\\n these their standard-bearers\\ntheir colours\\n and their scutcheons\\n and these the men undertheir command\\n  So\\n as was said\\n the brave Prince took hismarch to go to the town of Mansoul\\n  Captain Credence led thevan\\n and Captain Patience brought up the rear\\n so the otherthree\\n with their men\\n made up the main body\\n the Princehimself riding in his chariot at the head of them\\nBut when they set out for their march\\n oh\\n how the trumpetssounded\\n their armour glittered\\n and how the colours waved inthe wind\\n  The Prince\\'s armour was all of gold\\n and it shonelike the sun in the firmament\\n the captains\\' armour was ofproof\\n and was in appearance like the glittering stars\\nThere were also some from the court that rode reformades forthe love that they had to the King Shaddai\\n and for the happydeliverance of the town of Mansoul\\nEmmanuel also\\n when he had thus set forwards to go to recoverthe town of Mansoul\\n took with him\\n at the commandment of hisFather\\n fifty-four battering-rams\\n and twelve slings to whirlstones withal\\n  Every one of these was made of pure gold\\n andthese they carried with them\\n in the heart and body of theirarmy\\n all along as they went to Mansoul\\nSo they marched till they came within less than a league ofthe town\\n there they lay till the first four captains camethither to acquaint them with matters\\n  Then they took theirjourney to go to the town of Mansoul\\n and unto Mansoul theycame\\n but when the old soldiers that were in the camp sawthat they had new forces to join with\\n they again gave such ashout before the walls of the town of Mansoul\\n that it putDiabolus into another fright\\n  So they sat down before thetown\\n not now as the other four captains did\\n to wit\\n againstthe gates of Mansoul only\\n but they environed it round onevery side\\n and beset it behind and before\\n so that now\\n letMansoul look which way it will\\n it saw force and power lie insiege against it\\n  Besides\\n there were mounts cast up againstit\\n  The Mount Gracious was on the one side\\n and MountJustice was on the other\\n  Further\\n there were several smallbanks and advance-grounds\\n as Plain-Truth Hill and No-SinBanks\\n where many of the slings were placed against the town\\nUpon Mount Gracious were planted four\\n and upon Mount Justicewere placed as many\\n and the rest were conveniently placed inseveral parts round about the town\\n  Five of the bestbattering-rams\\n that is\\n of the biggest of them\\n were placedupon Mount Hearken\\n a mount cast up hard by Ear-gate\\n withintent to break that open\\nNow when the men of the town saw the multitude of thesoldiers that were come up against the place\\n and the ramsand slings\\n and the mounts on which they were planted\\ntogether with the glittering of the armour and the waving oftheir colours\\n they were forced to shift\\n and shift\\n andagain to shift their thoughts\\n but they hardly changed forthoughts more stout\\n but rather for thoughts more faint\\n forthough before they thought themselves sufficiently guarded\\nyet now they began to think that no man knew what would betheir hap or lot\\nWhen the good Prince Emmanuel had thus beleaguered Mansoul\\nin the first place he hangs out the white flag\\n which hecaused to be set up among the golden slings that were plantedupon Mount Gracious\\n  And this he did for two reasons\\n 1\\n Togive notice to Mansoul that he could and would yet begracious if they turned to him\\n  2\\n And that he might leavethem the more without excuse\\n should he destroy them\\n theycontinuing in their rebellion\\nSo the white flag\\n with the three golden doves in it\\n washung out for two days together\\n to give them time and spaceto consider\\n but they\\n as was hinted before\\n as if they wereunconcerned\\n made no reply to the favourable signal of thePrince\\nThen he commanded\\n and they set the red flag upon that mountcalled Mount Justice\\n  It was the red flag of CaptainJudgment\\n whose scutcheon was the burning fiery furnace\\n andthis also stood waving before them in the wind for severaldays together\\n  But look how they carried it under the whiteflag\\n when that was hung out\\n so did they also when the redone was\\n and yet he took no advantage of them\\nThen he commanded again that his servants should hang out theblack flag of defiance against them\\n whose scutcheon was thethree burning thunderbolts\\n but as unconcerned was Mansoul atthis as at those that went before\\n  But when the Prince sawthat neither mercy nor judgment\\n nor execution of judgment\\nwould or could come near the heart of Mansoul\\n he was touchedwith much compunction\\n and said\\n \\'Surely this strangecarriage of the town of Mansoul doth rather arise fromignorance of the manner and feats of war\\n than from a secretdefiance of us\\n and abhorrence of their own lives\\n or if theyknow the manner of the war of their own\\n yet not the ritesand ceremonies of the wars in which we are concerned\\n when Imake wars upon mine enemy Diabolus\\n\\'Therefore he sent to the town of Mansoul\\n to let them knowwhat he meant by those signs and ceremonies of the flag\\n andalso to know of them which of the things they would choose\\nwhether grace and mercy\\n or judgment and the execution ofjudgment\\n  All this while they kept their gates shut withlocks\\n bolts\\n and bars\\n as fast as they could\\n  Their guardsalso were doubled\\n and their watch made as strong as theycould\\n  Diabolus also did pluck up what heart he could\\n toencourage the town to make resistance\\nThe townsmen also made answer to the Prince\\'s messenger\\n insubstance according to that which follows\\n-\\'Great Sir\\n - As to what\\n by your messenger\\n you havesignified to us\\n whether we will accept of your mercy\\n orfall by your justice\\n we are bound by the law and custom ofthis place\\n and can give you no positive answer\\n for it isagainst the law\\n government\\n and the prerogative royal of ourking\\n to make either peace or war without him\\n  But this wewill do\\n - we will petition that our prince will come down tothe wall\\n and there give you such treatment as he shall thinkfit and profitable for us\\n\\'When the good Prince Emmanuel heard this answer\\n and saw theslavery and bondage of the people\\n and how much content theywere to abide in the chains of the tyrant Diabolus\\n itgrieved him at the heart\\n and\\n indeed\\n when at any time heperceived that any were contented under the slavery of thegiant\\n he would be affected with it\\nBut to return again to our purpose\\n  After the town hadcarried this news to Diabolus\\n and had told him\\n moreover\\nthat the Prince\\n that lay in the leaguer without the wall\\nwaited upon them for an answer\\n he refused\\n and huffed aswell as he could\\n but in heart he was afraid\\nThen said he\\n \\'I will go down to the gates myself\\n and givehim such an answer as I think fit\\n\\'  So he went down toMouth-gate\\n and there addressed himself to speak to Emmanuel\\n(but in such language as the town understood not\\n) thecontents whereof were as follows\\n-\\'O thou great Emmanuel\\n Lord of all the world\\n I know thee\\nthat thou art the Son of the great Shaddai\\n  Wherefore artthou come to torment me\\n and to cast me out of my possession\\nThis town of Mansoul\\n as thou very well knowest\\n is mine\\n andthat by a twofold right\\n 1\\n It is mine by right of conquest\\nI won it in the open field\\n and shall the prey be taken fromthe mighty\\n or the lawful captive be delivered\\n  2\\n This townof Mansoul is mine also by their subjection\\n  They haveopened the gates of their town unto me\\n they have swornfidelity to me\\n and have openly chosen me to be their king\\nthey have also given their castle into my hands\\n yea\\n theyhave put the whole strength of Mansoul under me\\n\\'Moreover\\n this town of Mansoul hath disavowed thee\\n yea\\nthey have cast thy law\\n thy name\\n thy image\\n and all that isthine\\n behind their back\\n and have accepted and set up intheir room my law\\n my name\\n my image\\n and all that ever ismine\\n  Ask else thy captains\\n and they will tell thee thatMansoul hath\\n in answer to all their summonses\\n shown loveand loyalty to me\\n but always disdain\\n despite\\n contempt\\n andscorn to thee and thine\\n  Now\\n thou art the Just One and theHoly\\n and shouldest do no iniquity\\n  Depart\\n then\\n I praythee\\n therefore\\n from me\\n and leave me to my just inheritancepeaceably\\n\\'This oration was made in the language of Diabolus himself\\nfor although he can\\n to every man\\n speak in their ownlanguage\\n (else he could not tempt them all as he does\\n) yethe has a language proper to himself\\n and it is the languageof the infernal cave\\n or black pit\\nWherefore the town of Mansoul (poor hearts\\n) understood himnot\\n nor did they see how he crouched and cringed while hestood before Emmanuel\\n their Prince\\nYea\\n they all this while took him to be one of that power andforce that by no means could be resisted\\n  Wherefore\\n whilehe was thus entreating that he might have yet his residencethere\\n and that Emmanuel would not take it from him by force\\nthe inhabitants boasted even of his valour\\n saying\\n \\'Who isable to make war with him\\n\\'Well\\n when this pretended king had made an end of what hewould say\\n Emmanuel\\n the golden Prince\\n stood up and spake\\nthe contents of whose words follow\\n-\\'Thou deceiving one\\n\\' said he\\n \\'I have\\n in my Father\\'s name\\nin mine own name\\n and on the behalf and for the good of thiswretched town of Mansoul\\n somewhat to say unto thee\\n  Thoupretendest a right\\n a lawful right\\n to the deplorable town ofMansoul\\n when it is most apparent to all my Father\\'s courtthat the entrance which thou hast obtained in at the gates ofMansoul was through thy lie and falsehood\\n thou beliedst myFather\\n thou beliedst his law\\n and so deceivedst the peopleof Mansoul\\n  Thou pretendest that the people have acceptedthee for their king\\n their captain\\n and right liege lord\\n butthat also was by the exercise of deceit and guile\\n  Now\\n iflying\\n wiliness\\n sinful craft\\n and all manner of horriblehypocrisy\\n will go in my Father\\'s court (in which court thoumust be tried) for equity and right\\n then will I confess untothee that thou hast made a lawful conquest\\n  But\\n alas\\n whatthief\\n what tyrant\\n what devil is there that may not conquerafter this sort\\n  But I can make it appear\\n O Diabolus\\n thatthou\\n in all thy pretences to a conquest of Mansoul\\n hastnothing of truth to say\\n  Thinkest thou this to be right\\nthat that didst put the lie upon my Father\\n and madest him(to Mansoul) the greatest deluder in the world\\n  And whatsayest thou to thy perverting knowingly the right purport andintent of the law\\n  Was it good also that thou madest a preyof the innocency and simplicity of the now miserable town ofMansoul\\n  Yea\\n thou didst overcome Mansoul by promising tothem happiness in their transgressions against my Father\\'slaw\\n when thou knewest\\n and couldest not but know\\n hadst thouconsulted nothing but thine own experience\\n that that was theway to undo them\\n  Thou hast also thyself\\n O thou master ofenmity\\n of spite defaced my Father\\'s image in Mansoul\\n andset up thy own in its place\\n to the great contempt of myFather\\n the heightening of thy sin\\n and to the intolerabledamage of the perishing town of Mansoul\\n\\'Thou hast\\n moreover\\n (as if all these were but little thingswith thee\\n) not only deluded and undone this place\\n but\\n bythy lies and fradulent carriage\\n hast set them against theirown deliverance\\n  How hast thou stirred them up against myFather\\'s captains\\n and made them to fight against those thatwere sent of him to deliver them from their bondage\\n  Allthese things\\n and very many more\\n thou hast done against thylight\\n and in contempt of my Father and of his law\\n yea\\n andwith design to bring under his displeasure for ever themiserable town of Mansoul\\n  I am therefore come to avenge thewrong that thou hast done to my Father\\n and to deal with theefor the blasphemies wherewith thou hast made poor Mansoulblaspheme his name\\n  Yea\\n upon thy head\\n thou prince of theinfernal cave\\n will I requite it\\n\\'As for myself\\n O Diabolus\\n I am come against thee by lawfulpower\\n and to take\\n by strength of hand\\n this town of Mansoulout of thy burning fingers\\n for this town of Mansoul is mine\\nO Diabolus\\n and that by undoubted right\\n as all shall seethat will diligently search the most ancient and mostauthentic records\\n and I will plead my title to it\\n to theconfusion of thy face\\n\\'First\\n for the town of Mansoul\\n my Father built and didfashion it with his hand\\n  The palace also that is in themidst of that town\\n he built it for his own delight\\n  Thistown of Mansoul\\n therefore\\n is my Father\\'s\\n and that by thebest of titles\\n and he that gainsays the truth of this mustlie against his soul\\n\\'Secondly\\n O thou master of the lie\\n this town of Mansoul ismine\\n\\'1\\n For that I am my Father\\'s heir\\n his firstborn\\n and theonly delight of his heart\\n  I am therefore come up againstthee in mine own right\\n even to recover mine own inheritanceout of thine hand\\n\\'2\\n But further\\n as I have a right and title to Mansoul bybeing my Father\\'s heir\\n so I have also by my Father\\'sdonation\\n  His it was\\n and he gave it me\\n nor have I at anytime offended my Father\\n that he should take it from me\\n andgive it to thee\\n  Nor have I been forced\\n by playing thebankrupt\\n to sell or set to sale to thee my beloved town ofMansoul\\n  Mansoul is my desire\\n my delight\\n and the joy of myheart\\n  But\\n\\'3\\n Mansoul is mine by right of purchase\\n  I have bought it\\nO Diabolus\\n I have bought it to myself\\n  Now\\n since it was myFather\\'s and mine\\n as I was his heir\\n and since also I havemade it mine by virtue of a great purchase\\n it followeththat\\n by all lawful right\\n the town of Mansoul is mine\\n andthat thou art an usurper\\n a tyrant\\n and traitor\\n in thyholding possession thereof\\n  Now\\n the cause of my purchasingof it was this\\n Mansoul had trespassed against my Father\\n nowmy Father had said\\n that in the day that they broke his lawthey should die\\n  Now\\n it is more possible for heaven andearth to pass away than for my Father to break his word\\nWherefore when Mansoul had sinned indeed by hearkening to thylie\\n I put in and became a surety to my Father\\n body forbody\\n and soul for soul\\n that I would make amends forMansoul\\'s transgressions\\n and my Father did accept thereof\\nSo\\n when the time appointed was come\\n I gave body for body\\nsoul for soul\\n life for life\\n blood for blood\\n and soredeemed my beloved Mansoul\\n\\'4\\n Nor did I do this by halves\\n my Father\\'s law and justice\\nthat were both concerned in the threatening upontransgression\\n are both now satisfied\\n and very well contentthat Mansoul should be delivered\\n\\'5\\n Nor am I come out this day against thee\\n but bycommandment of my Father\\n it was he that said unto me\\n \"Godown and deliver Mansoul\\n\"\\'Wherefore be it known unto thee\\n O thou fountain of deceit\\nand be it also known to the foolish town of Mansoul\\n that Iam not come against thee this day without my Father\\n\\'And now\\n\\' said the golden-headed Prince\\n \\'I have a word tothe town of Mansoul\\n\\'  But so soon as mention was made thathe had a word to speak to the besotted town of Mansoul\\n thegates were double-guarded\\n and all men commanded not to givehim audience\\n  So he proceeded and said\\n \\'O unhappy town ofMansoul\\n I cannot but be touched with pity and compassion forthee\\n  Thou hast accepted of Diabolus for thy king\\n and artbecome a nurse and minister of Diabolonians against thysovereign Lord\\n  Thy gates thou hast opened to him\\n but hastshut them fast against me\\n thou hast given him an hearing\\nbut hast stopped thine ears at my cry\\n  He brought to theethy destruction\\n and thou didst receive both him and it\\n I amcome to thee bringing salvation\\n but thou regardest me not\\nBesides\\n thou hast\\n as with sacrilegious hands\\n takenthyself\\n with all that was mine in thee\\n and hast given allto my foe\\n and to the greatest enemy my Father has\\n  You havebowed and subjected yourselves to him\\n you have vowed andsworn yourselves to be his\\n  Poor Mansoul\\n what shall I dounto thee\\n  Shall I save thee\\n - shall I destroy thee\\n  Whatshall I do unto thee\\n  Shall I fall upon thee\\n and grind theeto powder\\n or make thee a monument of the richest grace\\nWhat shall I do unto thee\\n  Hearken\\n therefore\\n thou town ofMansoul\\n hearken to my word\\n and thou shalt live\\n  I ammerciful\\n Mansoul\\n and thou shalt find me so\\n shut me not outof thy gates\\n\\'O Mansoul\\n neither is my commission nor inclination at allto do thee hurt\\n  Why fliest thou so fast from thy friend\\nand stickest so close to thine enemy\\n  Indeed\\n I would havethee\\n because it becomes thee to be sorry for thy sin\\n but donot despair of life\\n this great force is not to hurt thee\\nbut to deliver thee from thy bondage\\n and to reduce thee tothy obedience\\n\\'My commission\\n indeed\\n is to make a war upon Diabolus thyking\\n and upon all Diabolonians with him\\n for he is thestrong man armed that keeps the house\\n and I will have himout\\n his spoils I must divide\\n his armour I must take fromhim\\n his hold I must cast him out of\\n and must make it ahabitation for myself\\n  And this\\n O Mansoul\\n shall Diabolusknow when he shall be made to follow me in chains\\n and whenMansoul shall rejoice to see it so\\n \\'I could\\n would I now put forth my might\\n cause thatforthwith he should leave you and depart\\n but I have it in myheart so to deal with him\\n as that the justice of the warthat I shall make upon him may be seen and acknowledged byall\\n  He hath taken Mansoul by fraud\\n and keeps it byviolence and deceit\\n and I will make him bare and naked inthe eyes of all observers\\n\\'All my words are true\\n  I am mighty to save\\n and willdeliver my Mansoul out of his hand\\n\\'This speech was intended chiefly for Mansoul\\n but Mansoulwould not have the hearing of it\\n  They shut up Ear-gate\\nthey barricaded it up\\n they kept it locked and bolted\\n theyset a guard thereat\\n and commanded that no Mansoulonianshould go out to him\\n nor that any from the camp should beadmitted into the town\\n  All this they did\\n so horribly hadDiabolus enchanted them to do\\n and seek to do for him\\nagainst their rightful Lord and Prince\\n wherefore no man\\n norvoice\\n nor sound of man that belonged to the glorious host\\nwas to come into the town\\nSo when Emmanuel saw that Mansoul was thus involved in sin\\nhe calls his army together\\n (since now also his words weredespised\\n) and gave out a commandment throughout all his hostto be ready against the time appointed\\n  Now\\n forasmuch asthere was no way lawfully to take the town of Mansoul but toget in by the gates\\n and at Ear-gate as the chief\\n thereforehe commanded his captains and commanders to bring their rams\\ntheir slings and their men\\n and place them at Eye-gate andEar-gate\\n in order to his taking the town\\nWhen Emmanuel had put all things in a readiness to giveDiabolus battle\\n he sent again to know of the town ofMansoul\\n if in peaceable manner they would yield themselves\\nor whether they were yet resolved to put him to try theutmost extremity\\n  They then\\n together with Diabolus theirking\\n called a council of war\\n and resolved upon certainpropositions that should be offered to Emmanuel\\n if he willaccept thereof\\n so they agreed\\n and then the next was\\n whoshould be sent on this errand\\n  Now\\n there was in the town ofMansoul an old man\\n a Diabolonian\\n and his name was Mr\\n Loth-to-stoop\\n a stiff man in his way\\n and a great doer forDiabolus\\n him\\n therefore\\n they sent\\n and put into his mouthwhat he should say\\n  So he went and came to the camp toEmmanuel\\n and when he was come\\n a time was appointed to givehim audience\\n  So at the time he came\\n and after aDiabolonian ceremony or two\\n he thus began and said\\n \\'Greatsir\\n that it may be known unto all men how good-natured aprince my master is\\n he has sent me to tell your lordshipthat he is very willing\\n rather than go to war\\n to deliver upinto your hands one half of the town of Mansoul\\n  I amtherefore to know if your Mightiness will accept of thisproposition\\n\\'Then said Emmanuel\\n \\'The whole is mine by gift and purchase\\nwherefore I will never lose one half\\n\\'Then said Mr\\n Loth-to-stoop\\n \\'Sir\\n my master hath said thathe will be content that you shall be the nominal and titularLord of all\\n if he may possess but a part\\n\\'Then Emmanuel answered\\n \\'The whole is mine really\\n not inname and word only\\n wherefore I will be the sole lord andpossessor of all\\n or of none at all\\n of Mansoul\\n\\'Then Mr\\n Loth-to-stoop said again\\n \\'Sir\\n behold thecondescension of my master\\n  He says\\n that he will becontent\\n if he may but have assigned to him some place inMansoul as a place to live privately in\\n and you shall beLord of all the rest\\n\\'Then said the golden Prince\\n \\'All that the Father giveth meshall come to me\\n and of all that he giveth me I will losenothing - no\\n not a hoof nor a hair\\n  I will not\\n therefore\\ngrant him\\n no\\n not the least corner of Mansoul to dwell in\\n Iwill have all to myself\\n\\'Then Loth-to-stoop said again\\n \\'But\\n sir\\n suppose that myLord should resign the whole town to you\\n only with thisproviso\\n that he sometimes\\n when he comes into this country\\nmay\\n for old acquaintance\\' sake\\n be entertained as awayfaring man for two days\\n or ten days or a month\\n or so\\nMay not this small matter be granted\\n\\'Then said Emmanuel\\n \\'No\\n  He came as a wayfaring man toDavid\\n nor did he stay long with him\\n and yet it had like tohave cost David his soul\\n  I will not consent that he evershould have any harbour more there\\n\\'Then said Mr\\n Loth-to-stoop\\n \\'Sir\\n you seem to be very hard\\nSuppose my master should yield to all that your lordship hathsaid\\n provided that his friends and kindred in Mansoul mayhave liberty to trade in the town\\n and to enjoy their presentdwellings\\n  May not that be granted\\n sir\\n\\'Then said Emmanuel\\n \\'No\\n that is contrary to my Father\\'swill\\n for all\\n and all manner of Diabolonians that now are\\nor that at any time shall be found in Mansoul\\n shall not onlylose their lands and liberties\\n but also their lives\\n\\'Then said Mr\\n Loth-to-stoop again\\n \\'But\\n sir\\n may not mymaster and great lord\\n by letters\\n by passengers\\n byaccidental opportunities\\n and the like\\n maintain\\n if he shalldeliver up all unto thee\\n some kind of old friendship withMansoul\\n\\'Emmanuel answered\\n \\'No\\n by no means\\n forasmuch as any suchfellowship\\n friendship\\n intimacy\\n or acquaintance\\n in whatway\\n sort\\n or mode soever maintained\\n will tend to thecorrupting of Mansoul\\n the alienating of their affectionsfrom me\\n and the endangering of their peace with my Father\\n\\'Mr\\n Loth-to-stoop yet added further\\n saying\\n \\'But\\n great sir\\nsince my master hath many friends\\n and those that are dear tohim\\n in Mansoul\\n may he not\\n if he shall depart from them\\neven of his bounty and good-nature\\n bestow upon them\\n as hesees fit\\n some tokens of his love and kindness that he hadfor them\\n to the end that Mansoul\\n when he is gone\\n may lookupon such tokens of kindness once received from their oldfriend\\n and remember him who was once their king\\n and themerry times that they sometimes enjoyed one with another\\nwhile he and they lived in peace together\\n\\'Then said Emmanuel\\n \\'No\\n for if Mansoul come to be mine\\n Ishall not admit of nor consent that there should be the leastscrap\\n shred\\n or dust of Diabolus left behind\\n as tokens ofgifts bestowed upon any in Mansoul\\n thereby to call toremembrance the horrible communion that was betwixt them andhim\\n\\'\\'Well\\n sir\\n\\' said Mr\\n Loth-to-stoop\\n \\'I have one thing moreto propound\\n and then I am got to the end of my commission\\nSuppose that\\n when my master is gone from Mansoul\\n any thatshall yet live in the town should have such business of highconcerns to do\\n that if they be neglected the party shall beundone\\n and suppose\\n sir\\n that nobody can help in that caseso well as my master and lord\\n may not now my master be sentfor upon so urgent an occasion as this\\n  Or if he may not beadmitted into the town\\n may not he and the person concernedmeet in some of the villages near Mansoul\\n and there laytheir heads together\\n and there consult of matters\\n\\'This was the last of those ensnaring propositions that Mr\\nLoth-to-stoop had to propound to Emmanuel on behalf of hismaster Diabolus\\n but Emmanuel would not grant it\\n for hesaid\\n \\'There can be no case\\n or thing\\n or matter fall out inMansoul\\n when thy master shall be gone\\n that may not besolved by my Father\\n besides\\n it will be a greatdisparagement to my Father\\'s wisdom and skill to admit anyfrom Mansoul to go out to Diabolus for advice\\n when they arebid before\\n in everything\\n by prayer and supplication to lettheir requests be made known to my Father\\n  Further\\n this\\nshould it be granted\\n would be to grant that a door should beset open for Diabolus\\n and the Diabolonians in Mansoul\\n tohatch\\n and plot\\n and bring to pass treasonable designs\\n tothe grief of my Father and me\\n and to the utter destructionof Mansoul\\n\\'When Mr\\n Loth-to-stoop had heard this answer\\n he took hisleave of Emmanuel\\n and departed\\n saying that he would carryword to his master concerning this whole affair\\n  So hedeparted\\n and came to Diabolus to Mansoul\\n and told him thewhole of the matter\\n and how Emmanuel would not admit\\n no\\nnot by any means\\n that he\\n when he was once gone out\\n shouldfor ever have anything more to do either in\\n or with any thatare of the town of Mansoul\\n  When Mansoul and Diabolus hadheard this relation of things\\n they with one consentconcluded to use their best endeavour to keep Emmanuel out ofMansoul\\n and sent old Ill-Pause\\n of whom you have heardbefore\\n to tell the Prince and his captains so\\n  So the oldgentleman came up to the top of Ear-gate\\n and called to thecamp for a hearing\\n who when they gave audience\\n he said\\n \\'Ihave in commandment from my high lord to bid you tell it toyour Prince Emmanuel\\n that Mansoul and their king areresolved to stand and fall together\\n and that it is in vainfor your Prince to think of ever having Mansoul in his hand\\nunless he can take it by force\\n\\'  So some went and told toEmmanuel what old Ill-Pause\\n a Diabolonian in Mansoul\\n hadsaid\\n  Then said the Prince\\n \\'I must try the power of mysword\\n for I will not (for all the rebellions and repulsesthat Mansoul has made against me) raise my siege and depart\\nbut will assuredly take my Mansoul\\n and deliver it from thehand of her enemy\\n\\'  And with that he gave out a commandmentthat Captain Boanerges\\n Captain Conviction\\n Captain Judgment\\nand Captain Execution should forthwith march up to Ear-gatewith trumpets sounding\\n colours flying\\n and with shouting forthe battle\\n  Also he would that Captain Credence should joinhimself with them\\n  Emmanuel\\n moreover\\n gave order thatCaptain Good-Hope and Captain Charity should draw themselvesup before Eye-gate\\n  He bid also that the rest of hiscaptains and their men should place themselves for the bestof their advantage against the enemy round about the town\\nand all was done as he had commanded\\nThen he bid that the word should be given forth\\n and the wordwas at that time\\n \\'EMMANUEL\\n\\'  Then was an alarm sounded\\n andthe battering-rams were played\\n and the slings did whirlstones into the town amain\\n and thus the battle began\\n  NowDiabolus himself did manage the townsmen in the war\\n and thatat every gate\\n wherefore their resistance was the moreforcible\\n hellish\\n and offensive to Emmanuel\\n  Thus was thegood Prince engaged and entertained by Diabolus and Mansoulfor several days together\\n and a sight worth seeing it was tobehold how the captains of Shaddai behaved themselves in thiswar\\nAnd first for Captain Boanerges\\n (not to under-value therest\\n) he made three most fierce assaults\\n one after another\\nupon Ear-gate\\n to the shaking of the posts thereof\\n  CaptainConviction\\n he also made up as fast with Boanerges aspossibly he could\\n and both discerning that the gate began toyield\\n they commanded that the rams should still be playedagainst it\\n  Now\\n Captain Conviction\\n going up very near tothe gate\\n was with great force driven back\\n and receivedthree wounds in the mouth\\n  And those that rode reformades\\nthey went about to encourage the captains\\nFor the valour of the two captains\\n made mention of before\\nthe Prince sent for them to his pavilion\\n and commanded thata while they should rest themselves\\n and that with somewhatthey should be refreshed\\n  Care also was taken for CaptainConviction\\n that he should be healed of his wounds\\n  ThePrince also gave to each of them a chain of gold\\n and bidthem yet be of good courage\\nNor did Captain Good-Hope nor Captain Charity come behind inthis most desperate fight\\n for they so well did behavethemselves at Eye-gate\\n that they had almost broken it quiteopen\\n  These also had a reward from their Prince\\n as also hadthe rest of the captains\\n because they did valiantly roundabout the town\\nIn this engagement several of the officers of Diabolus wereslain\\n and some of the townsmen wounded\\n  For the officers\\nthere was one Captain Boasting slain\\n  This Boasting thoughtthat nobody could have shaken the posts of Ear-gate\\n nor haveshaken the heart of Diabolus\\n  Next to him there was oneCaptain Secure slain\\n this Secure used to say that the blindand lame in Mansoul were able to keep the gates of the townagainst Emmanuel\\'s army\\n  This Captain Secure did CaptainConviction cleave down the head with a two-handed sword\\n whenhe received himself three wounds in his mouth\\nBesides these there was one Captain Bragman\\n a very desperatefellow\\n and he was captain over a band of those that threwfirebrands\\n arrows\\n and death\\n he also received\\n by the handof Captain Good-Hope at Eye-gate\\n a mortal wound in thebreast\\nThere was\\n moreover\\n one Mr\\n Feeling\\n but he was no captain\\nbut a great stickler to encourage Mansoul to rebellion\\n  Hereceived a wound in the eye by the hand of one of Boanerges\\'soldiers\\n and had by the captain himself been slain\\n but thathe made a sudden retreat\\nBut I never saw Willbewill so daunted in all my life\\n he wasnot able to do as he was wont\\n and some say that he alsoreceived a wound in the leg\\n and that some of the men in thePrince\\'s army have certainly seen him limp as he afterwardswalked on the wall\\nI shall not give you a particular account of the names of thesoldiers that were slain in the town\\n for many were maimed\\nand wounded\\n and slain\\n for when they saw that the posts ofEar-gate did shake\\n and Eye-gate was well-nigh broken quiteopen\\n and also that their captains were slain\\n this took awaythe hearts of many of the Diabolonians\\n they fell also by theforce of the shot that were sent by the golden slings intothe midst of the town of Mansoul\\nOf the townsmen\\n there was one Love-no-Good\\n he was atownsman\\n but a Diabolonian\\n he also received his mortalwound in Mansoul\\n but he died not very soon\\nMr\\n Ill-Pause also\\n who was the man that came along withDiabolus when at first he attempted the taking of Mansoul\\n healso received a grievous wound in the head\\n some say that hisbrain-pan was cracked\\n  This I have taken notice of\\n that hewas never after this able to do that mischief to Mansoul ashe had done in times past\\n  Also old Prejudice and Mr\\nAnything fled\\nNow\\n when the battle was over\\n the Prince commanded that yetonce more the white flag should be set upon Mount Gracious insight of the town of Mansoul\\n to show that yet Emmanuel hadgrace for the wretched town of Mansoul\\nWhen Diabolus saw the white flag hung out again\\n and knowingthat it was not for him\\n but Mansoul\\n he cast in his mind toplay another prank\\n to wit\\n to see if Emmanuel would raisehis siege and begone\\n upon promise of reformation\\n  So hecomes down to the gate one evening\\n a good while after thesun was gone down\\n and calls to speak with Emmanuel\\n whopresently came down to the gate\\n and Diabolus saith unto him\\n\\'Forasmuch as thou makest it appear by thy white flag thatthou art wholly given to peace and quiet\\n I thought meet toacquaint thee that we are ready to accept thereof upon termswhich thou mayest admit\\n\\'I know that thou art given to devotion\\n and that holinesspleaseth thee\\n yea\\n that thy great end in making a war uponMansoul is\\n that it may be a holy habitation\\n  Well\\n draw offthy forces from the town\\n and I will bend Mansoul to thy bow\\n\\'First\\n I will lay down all acts of hostility against thee\\nand will be willing to become thy deputy\\n and will\\n as I haveformerly been against thee\\n now serve thee in the town ofMansoul\\n  And more particularly\\n\\'1\\n I will persuade Mansoul to receive thee for their Lord\\nand I know that they will do it the sooner when they shallunderstand that I am thy deputy\\n\\'2\\n I will show them wherein they have erred\\n and thattransgression stands in the way to life\\n\\'3\\n I will show them the holy law unto which they mustconform\\n even that which they have broken\\n\\'4\\n I will press upon them the necessity of a reformationaccording to thy law\\n\\'5\\n And\\n moreover\\n that none of these things may fail\\n Imyself\\n at my own proper cost and charge\\n will set up andmaintain a sufficient ministry\\n besides lectures\\n in Mansoul\\n\\'6\\n Thou shalt receive\\n as a token of our subjection to thee\\nyear by year\\n what thou shalt think fit to lay and levy uponus in token of our subjection to thee\\n\\'Then said Emmanuel to him\\n \\'O full of deceit\\n how movable arethy ways\\n  How often hast thou changed and rechanged\\n if sobe thou mightest still keep possession of my Mansoul\\n though\\nas has been plainly declared before\\n I am the right heirthereof\\n  Often hast thou made thy proposals already\\n nor isthis last a whit better than they\\n  And failing to deceivewhen thou showedst thyself in thy black\\n thou hast nowtransformed thyself into an angel of light\\n and wouldst\\n todeceive\\n be now as a minister of righteousness\\n\\'But know thou\\n O Diabolus\\n that nothing must be regardedthat thou canst propound\\n for nothing is done by thee but todeceive\\n  Thou neither hast conscience to God\\n nor love tothe town of Mansoul\\n whence\\n then\\n should these thy sayingsarise but from sinful craft and deceit\\n  He that can of listand will propound what he pleases\\n and that wherewith he maydestroy them that believe him\\n is to be abandoned\\n with allthat he shall say\\n  But if righteousness be such a beauty-spot in thine eyes now\\n how is it that wickedness was soclosely stuck to by thee before\\n  But this is by-the-bye\\n\\'Thou talkest now of a reformation in Mansoul\\n and that thouthyself\\n if I will please\\n wilt be at the head of thatreformation\\n all the while knowing that the greatestproficiency that man can make in the law\\n and therighteousness thereof\\n will amount to no more\\n for the takingaway of the curse from Mansoul\\n than just nothing at all\\n fora law being broken by Mansoul\\n that had before\\n upon asupposition of the breach thereof\\n a curse pronounced againsthim for it of God\\n can never\\n by his obeying of the law\\ndeliver himself therefrom (to say nothing of what areformation is like to be set up in Mansoul when the devil isbecome corrector of vice)\\n  Thou knowest that all that thouhast now said in this matter is nothing but guile and deceit\\nand is\\n as it was the first\\n so is it the last card that thouhast to play\\n  Many there be that do soon discern thee whenthou showest them thy cloven foot\\n but in thy white\\n thylight\\n and in thy transformation\\n thou art seen but of a few\\nBut thou shalt not do thus with my Mansoul\\n O Diabolus\\n for Ido still love my Mansoul\\n\\'Besides\\n I am not come to put Mansoul upon works to livethereby\\n should I do so\\n I should be like unto thee\\n but I amcome that by me\\n and by what I have and shall do for Mansoul\\nthey may to my Father be reconciled\\n though by their sin theyhave provoked him to anger\\n and though by the law they cannotobtain mercy\\n\\'Thou talkest of subjecting of this town to good\\n when nonedesireth it at thy hands\\n  I am sent by my Father to possessit myself\\n and to guide it by the skilfulness of my handsinto such a conformity to him as shall be pleasing in hissight\\n  I will therefore possess it myself\\n I will dispossessand cast thee out\\n I will set up mine own standard in themidst of them\\n I will also govern them by new laws\\n newofficers\\n new motives\\n and new ways\\n yea\\n I will pull downthis town\\n and build it again\\n and it shall be as though ithad not been\\n and it shall then be the glory of the wholeuniverse\\n\\'When Diabolus heard this\\n and perceived that he wasdiscovered in all his deceits\\n he was confounded\\n and utterlyput to a nonplus\\n but having in himself the fountain ofiniquity\\n rage\\n and malice against both Shaddai and his Son\\nand the beloved town of Mansoul\\n what doth he but strengthenhimself what he could to give fresh battle to the noblePrince Emmanuel\\n  So\\n then\\n now we must have another fightbefore the town of Mansoul is taken\\n  Come up\\n then\\n to themountains\\n you that love to see military actions\\n and beholdby both sides how the fatal blow is given\\n while one seeks tohold\\n and the other seeks to make himself master of thefamous town of Mansoul\\nDiabolus\\n therefore\\n having withdrawn himself from the wallto his force that was in the heart of the town of Mansoul\\nEmmanuel also returned to the camp\\n and both of them\\n aftertheir divers ways\\n put themselves into a posture fit to givebattle one to another\\nDiabolus\\n as filled with despair of retaining in his handsthe famous town of Mansoul\\n resolved to do what mischief hecould (if\\n indeed\\n he could do any) to the army of the Princeand to the famous town of Mansoul\\n for\\n alas\\n it was not thehappiness of the silly town of Mansoul that was designed byDiabolus\\n but the utter ruin and overthrow thereof\\n as now isenough in view\\n  Wherefore\\n he commands his officers thatthey should then\\n when they see that they could hold the townno longer\\n do it what harm and mischief they could\\n renderingand tearing men\\n women\\n and children\\n  \\'For\\n\\' said he\\n \\'wehad better quite demolish the place\\n and leave it like aruinous heap\\n than so leave it that it may be an habitationfor Emmanuel\\n\\'Emmanuel again\\n knowing that the next battle would issue inhis being made master of the place\\n gave out a royalcommandment to all his officers\\n high captains\\n and men ofwar\\n to be sure to show themselves men of war againstDiabolus and all Diabolonians\\n but favourable\\n merciful\\n andmeek to the old inhabitants of Mansoul\\n  \\'Bend\\n therefore\\n\\'said the noble Prince\\n \\'the hottest front of the battleagainst Diabolus and his men\\n\\'So the day being come\\n the command was given\\n and thePrince\\'s men did bravely stand to their arms\\n and did\\n asbefore\\n bend their main force against Ear-gate and Eye-gate\\nThe word was then\\n \\'Mansoul is won\\n\\' so they made theirassault upon the town\\n  Diabolus also\\n as fast as he could\\nwith the main of his power\\n made resistance from within\\n andhis high lords and chief captains for a time fought verycruelly against the Prince\\'s army\\nBut after three or four notable charges by the Prince and hisnoble captains\\n Ear-gate was broken open\\n and the bars andbolts wherewith it was used to be fast shut up against thePrince\\n were broken into a thousand pieces\\n  Then did thePrince\\'s trumpets sound\\n the captains shout\\n the town shake\\nand Diabolus retreat to his hold\\n  Well\\n when the Prince\\'sforces had broken open the gate\\n himself came up and did sethis throne in it\\n also he set his standard thereby\\n upon amount that before by his men was cast up to place the mightyslings thereon\\n  The mount was called Mount Hear-well\\nThere\\n therefore\\n the Prince abode\\n to wit\\n hard by the goingin at the gate\\n  He commanded also that the golden slingsshould yet be played upon the town\\n especially against thecastle\\n because for shelter thither was Diabolus retreated\\nNow\\n from Ear-gate the street was straight even to the houseof Mr\\n Recorder that so was before Diabolus took the town\\nand hard by his house stood the castle\\n which Diabolus for along time had made his irksome den\\n  The captains\\n therefore\\ndid quickly clear that street by the use of their slings\\n sothat way was made up to the heart of the town\\n  Then did thePrince command that Captain Boanerges\\n Captain Conviction\\nand Captain Judgment\\n should forthwith march up the town tothe old gentleman\\'s gate\\n  Then did the captains in the mostwarlike manner enter into the town of Mansoul\\n and marchingin with flying colours\\n they came up to the Recorder\\'s house\\nand that was almost as strong as was the castle\\n  Battering-rams they took also with them\\n to plant against the castlegates\\n  When they were come to the house of Mr\\n Conscience\\nthey knocked\\n and demanded entrance\\n  Now\\n the old gentleman\\nnot knowing as yet fully their design\\n kept his gates shutall the time of this fight\\n  Wherefore Boanerges demandedentrance at his gates\\n and no man making answer\\n he gave itone stroke with the head of a ram\\n and this made the oldgentleman shake\\n and his house to tremble and totter\\n  Thencame Mr\\n Recorder down to the gates\\n and\\n as he could\\n withquivering lips he asked who was there\\n  Boanerges answered\\n\\'We are the captains and commanders of the great Shaddai andof the blessed Emmanuel\\n his Son\\n and we demand possession ofyour house for the use of our noble Prince\\n\\'  And with thatthe battering-ram gave the gate another shake\\n  This made theold gentleman tremble the more\\n yet durst he not but open thegate\\n then the King\\'s forces marched in\\n namely\\n the threebrave captains mentioned before\\n  Now\\n the Recorder\\'s housewas a place of much convenience for Emmanuel\\n not onlybecause it was near to the castle and strong\\n but alsobecause it was large\\n and fronted the castle\\n the den wherenow Diabolus was\\n for he was now afraid to come out of hishold\\n  As for Mr\\n Recorder\\n the captains carried it veryreservedly to him\\n as yet he knew nothing of the greatdesigns of Emmanuel\\n so that he did not know what judgment tomake\\n nor what would be the end of such thunderingbeginnings\\n  It was also presently noised in the town how theRecorder\\'s house was possessed\\n his rooms taken up\\n and hispalace made the seat of the war\\n and no sooner was it noisedabroad\\n but they took the alarm as warmly\\n and gave it out toothers of his friends\\n and you know\\n as a snowball losesnothing by rolling\\n so in little time the whole town waspossessed that they must expect nothing from the Prince butdestruction\\n and the ground of the business was this\\n theRecorder was afraid\\n the Recorder trembled\\n and the captainscarried it strangely to the Recorder\\n  So many came to see\\nbut when they with their own eyes did behold the captains inthe palace\\n and their battering-rams ever playing at thecastle gates to beat them down\\n they were riveted in theirfears\\n and it made them all in amaze\\n  And\\n as I said\\n theman of the house would increase all this\\n for whoever came tohim\\n or discoursed with him\\n nothing would he talk of\\n tellthem\\n or hear\\n but that death and destruction now attendedMansoul\\n\\'For\\n\\' quoth the old gentleman\\n \\'you are all of you sensiblethat we all have been traitors to that once despised\\n but nowfamously victorious and glorious Prince Emmanuel\\n for he now\\nas you see\\n doth not only lie in close siege about us\\n buthath forced his entrance in at our gates\\n  Moreover\\n Diabolusflees before him\\n and he hath\\n as you behold\\n made of myhouse a garrison against the castle where he is\\n  I\\n for mypart\\n have transgressed greatly\\n and he that is clean\\n it iswell for him\\n  But I say I have transgressed greatly inkeeping silence when I should have spoken\\n and in pervertingjustice when I should have executed the same\\n  True\\n I havesuffered something at the hand of Diabolus for taking partwith the laws of King Shaddai\\n but that\\n alas\\n what will thatdo\\n Will that make compensation for the rebellions andtreasons that I have done\\n and have suffered withoutgainsaying to be committed in the town of Mansoul\\n Oh\\n Itremble to think what will be the end of this so dreadful andso ireful a beginning\\n\\'Now\\n while these brave captains were thus busy in the houseof the old Recorder\\n Captain Execution was as busy in otherparts of the town\\n in securing the back streets and thewalls\\n  He also hunted the Lord Willbewill sorely\\n hesuffered him not to rest in any corner\\n he pursued him sohard that he drove his men from him\\n and made him glad tothrust his head into a hole\\n  Also this mighty warrior didcut three of the Lord Willbewill\\'s officers down to theground\\n one was old Mr\\n Prejudice\\n he that had his crowncracked in the mutiny\\n  This man was made by Lord Willbewillkeeper of the Ear-gate\\n and fell by the hand of CaptainExecution\\n  There was also one Mr\\n Backward-to-all-but-naught\\n and he also was one of Lord Willbewill\\'s officers\\nand was the captain of the two guns that once were mounted onthe top of Ear-gate\\n he also was cut down to the ground bythe hands of Captain Execution\\n  Besides these two there wasanother\\n a third\\n and his name was Captain Treacherous\\n avile man this was\\n but one that Willbewill did put a greatdeal of confidence in\\n but him also did this CaptainExecution cut down to the ground with the rest\\nHe also made a very great slaughter among my LordWillbewill\\'s soldiers\\n killing many that were stout andsturdy\\n and wounding many that for Diabolus were nimble andactive\\n  But all these were Diabolonians\\n there was not aman\\n a native of Mansoul\\n hurt\\nOther feats of war were also likewise performed by other ofthe captains\\n as at Eye-gate\\n where Captain Good-Hope andCaptain Charity had a charge\\n was great execution done\\n forthe Captain Good-Hope\\n with his own hands\\n slew one CaptainBlindfold\\n the keeper of that gate\\n  This Blindfold wascaptain of a thousand men\\n and they were they that foughtwith mauls\\n he also pursued his men\\n slew many\\n and woundedmore\\n and made the rest hide their heads in corners\\nThere was also at that gate Mr\\n Ill-Pause\\n of whom you haveheard before\\n  He was an old man\\n and had a beard thatreached down to his girdle\\n the same was he that was oratorto Diabolus\\n he did much mischief in the town of Mansoul\\n andfell by the hand of Captain Good-Hope\\nWhat shall I say\\n  The Diabolonians in these days lay dead inevery corner\\n though too many yet were alive in Mansoul\\nNow\\n the old Recorder and my Lord Understanding\\n with someothers of the chief of the town\\n to wit\\n such as knew theymust stand and fall with the famous town of Mansoul\\n cametogether upon a day\\n and after consultation had\\n did jointlyagree to draw up a petition\\n and to send it to Emmanuel\\n nowwhile he sat in the gate of Mansoul\\n  So they drew up theirpetition to Emmanuel\\n the contents whereof were these\\n Thatthey\\n the old inhabitants of the now deplorable town ofMansoul\\n confessed their sin\\n and were sorry that they hadoffended his princely Majesty\\n and prayed that he would sparetheir lives\\nUnto this petition he gave no answer at all\\n and that didtrouble them yet so much the more\\n  Now\\n all this while thecaptains that were in the Recorder\\'s house were playing withthe battering-rams at the gates of the castle\\n to beat themdown\\n  So after some time\\n labour\\n and travail\\n the gate ofthe castle that was called Impregnable was beaten open\\n andbroken into several splinters\\n and so a way made to go up tothe hold in which Diabolus had hid himself\\n  Then weretidings sent down to Ear-gate\\n for Emmanuel still abodethere\\n to let him know that a way was made in at the gates ofthe castle of Mansoul\\n  But\\n oh\\n how the trumpets at thetidings sounded throughout the Prince\\'s camp\\n for that nowthe war was so near an end\\n and Mansoul itself of being setfree\\nThen the Prince arose from the place where he was\\n and tookwith him such of his men of war as were fittest for thatexpedition\\n and marched up the street of Mansoul to the oldRecorder\\'s house\\nNow\\n the Prince himself was clad all in armour of gold\\n andso he marched up the town with his standard borne before him\\nbut he kept his countenance much reserved all the way as hewent\\n so that the people could not tell how to gather tothemselves love or hatred by his looks\\n  Now\\n as he marchedup the street\\n the townsfolk came out at every door to see\\nand could not but be taken with his person and the glorythereof\\n but wondered at the reservedness of his countenance\\nfor as yet he spake more to them by his actions and worksthan he did by words or smiles\\n  But also poor Mansoul\\n (asin such cases all are apt to do\\n) they interpreted thecarriage of Emmanuel to them as did Joseph\\'s brethren his tothem\\n even all the quite contrary way\\n  \\'For\\n\\' thought they\\n\\'if Emmanuel loved us\\n he would show it to us by word ofcarriage\\n but none of these he doth\\n therefore Emmanuel hatesus\\n  Now\\n if Emmanuel hates us\\n then Mansoul shall be slain\\nthen Mansoul shall become a dunghill\\n\\'  They knew that theyhad transgressed his Father\\'s law\\n and that against him theyhad been in with Diabolus\\n his enemy\\n  They also knew thatthe Prince Emmanuel knew all this\\n for they were convincedthat he was an angel of God\\n to know all things that are donein the earth\\n and this made them think that their conditionwas miserable\\n and that the good Prince would make themdesolate\\n\\'And\\n\\' thought they\\n \\'what time so fit to do this in as now\\nwhen he has the bridle of Mansoul in his hand\\n\\'  And this Itook special notice of\\n that the inhabitants\\n notwithstandingall this\\n could not - no\\n they could not\\n when they see himmarch through the town\\n but cringe\\n bow\\n bend\\n and were readyto lick the dust of his feet\\n  They also wished a thousandtimes over that he would become their Prince and Captain\\n andwould become their protection\\n  They would also one toanother talk of the comeliness of his person\\n and how muchfor glory and valour he outstripped the great ones of theworld\\n  But\\n poor hearts\\n as to themselves\\n their thoughtswould chance\\n and go upon all manner of extremes\\n  Yea\\nthrough the working of them backward and forward\\n Mansoulbecame as a ball tossed\\n and as a rolling thing before thewhirlwind\\nNow\\n when he was come to the castle gates\\n he commandedDiabolus to appear\\n and to surrender himself into his hands\\nBut\\n oh\\n how loath was the beast to appear\\n how he stuck atit\\n how he shrank\\n how he cringed\\n yet out he came to thePrince\\n  Then Emmanuel commanded\\n and they took Diabolus andbound him fast in chains\\n the better to reserve him to thejudgment that he had appointed for him\\n  But Diabolus stoodup to entreat for himself that Emmanuel would not send himinto the deep\\n but suffer him to depart out of Mansoul inpeace\\nWhen Emmanuel had taken him and bound him in chains\\n he ledhim into the marketplace\\n and there\\n before Mansoul\\n strippedhim of his armour in which he boasted so much before\\n  Thisnow was one of the acts of triumph of Emmanuel over hisenemy\\n and all the while that the giant was stripping\\n thetrumpets of the golden Prince did sound amain\\n the captainsalso shouted\\n and the soldiers did sing for joy\\nThen was Mansoul called upon to behold the beginning ofEmmanuel\\'s triumph over him in whom they so much had trusted\\nand of whom they so much had boasted in the days when heflattered them\\nThus having made Diabolus naked in the eyes of Mansoul\\n andbefore the commanders of the Prince\\n in the next place\\n hecommands that Diabolus should be bound with chains to hischariot wheels\\n  Then leaving some of his forces\\n to wit\\nCaptain Boanerges and Captain Conviction\\n as a guard for thecastle-gates\\n that resistance might be made on his behalf\\n(if any that heretofore followed Diabolus should make anattempt to possess it\\n) he did ride in triumph over him quitethrough the town of Mansoul\\n and so out at and before thegate called Eye-gate\\n to the plain where his camp did lie\\nBut you cannot think\\n unless you had been there\\n as I was\\nwhat a shout there was in Emmanuel\\'s camp when they saw thetyrant bound by the hand of their noble Prince\\n and tied tohis chariot wheels\\nAnd they said\\n \\'He hath led captivity captive\\n he hathspoiled principalities and powers\\n  Diabolus is subjected tothe power of his sword\\n and made the object of all derision\\n\\'Those also that rode reformades\\n and that came down to seethe battle\\n they shouted with that greatness of voice\\n andsung with such melodious notes\\n that they caused them thatdwell in the highest orbs to open their windows\\n put outtheir heads\\n and look to see the cause of that glory\\nThe townsmen also\\n so many of them as saw this sight\\n were\\nas it were\\n while they looked\\n betwixt the earth and theheavens\\n  True\\n they could not tell what would be the issueof things as to them\\n but all things were done in suchexcellent methods\\n and I cannot tell how\\n but things in themanagement of them seemed to cast a smile towards the town\\nso that their eyes\\n their heads\\n their hearts\\n and theirminds\\n and all that they had\\n were taken and held while theyobserved Emmanuel\\'s order\\nSo\\n when the brave Prince had finished this part of histriumph over Diabolus his foe\\n he turned him up in the midstof his contempt and shame\\n having given him a charge no moreto be a possessor of Mansoul\\n  Then went he from Emmanuel\\nand out of the midst of his camp\\n to inherit the parchedplaces in a salt land\\n seeking rest\\n but finding none\\nNow\\n Captain Boanerges and Captain Conviction were\\n both ofthem\\n men of very great majesty\\n their faces were like thefaces of lions\\n and their words like the roaring of the sea\\nand they still quartered in Mr\\n Conscience\\'s house\\n of whommention was made before\\n  When\\n therefore\\n the high andmighty Prince had thus far finished his triumph overDiabolus\\n the townsmen had more leisure to view and to beholdthe actions of these noble captains\\n  But the captainscarried it with that terror and dread in all that they did\\n(and you may be sure that they had private instructions so todo\\n) that they kept the town under continual heart-aching\\nand caused (in their apprehension) the well-being of Mansoulfor the future to hang in doubt before them\\n so that for someconsiderable time they neither knew what rest\\n or ease\\n orpeace\\n or hope meant\\nNor did the Prince himself as yet abide in the town ofMansoul\\n but in his royal pavilion in the camp\\n and in themidst of his Father\\'s forces\\n  So\\n at a time convenient\\n hesent special orders to Captain Boanerges to summons Mansoul\\nthe whole of the townsmen\\n into the castle-yard\\n and then andthere\\n before their faces\\n to take my Lord Understanding\\n Mr\\nConscience\\n and that notable one\\n the Lord Willbewill\\n andput them all three in ward\\n and that they should set a strongguard upon them there\\n until his pleasure concerning them wasfurther known\\n the which orders\\n when the captains had putthem in execution\\n made no small addition to the fears of thetown of Mansoul\\n for now\\n to their thinking\\n were theirformer fears of the ruin of Mansoul confirmed\\n  Now\\n whatdeath they should die\\n and how long they should be in dying\\nwas that which most perplexed their heads and hearts\\n yea\\nthey were afraid that Emmanuel would command them all intothe deep\\n the place that the prince Diabolus was afraid of\\nfor they knew that they had deserved it\\n  Also to die by thesword in the face of the town\\n and in the open way ofdisgrace\\n from the hand of so good and so holy a prince\\nthat\\n too\\n troubled them sore\\n  The town was also greatlytroubled for the men that were committed to ward\\n for thatthey were their stay and their guide\\n and for that theybelieved that\\n if those men were cut off\\n their executionwould be but the beginning of the ruin of the town ofMansoul\\n  Wherefore\\n what do they\\n but\\n together with the menin prison\\n draw up a petition to the Prince\\n and sent it toEmmanuel by the hand of Mr\\n Would-live\\n  So he went\\n and cameto the Prince\\'s quarters\\n and presented the petition\\n the sumof which was this\\n\\'Great and wonderful Potentate\\n victor over Diabolus\\n andconqueror of the town of Mansoul\\n We\\n the miserableinhabitants of that most woful corporation\\n do humbly begthat we may find favour in thy sight\\n and remember notagainst us former transgressions\\n nor yet the sins of thechief of our town\\n but spare us according to the greatness ofthy mercy\\n and let us not die\\n but live in thy sight\\n  Soshall we be willing to be thy servants\\n and\\n if thou shaltthink fit\\n to gather our meat under thy table\\n  Amen\\n\\'So the petitioner went\\n as was said\\n with his petition to thePrince\\n and the Prince took it at his hand\\n but sent him awaywith silence\\n  This still afflicted the town of Mansoul\\n butyet\\n considering that now they must either petition or die\\nfor now they could not do anything else\\n therefore theyconsulted again\\n and sent another petition\\n and this petitionwas much after the form and method of the former\\nBut when the petition was drawn up\\n By whom should they sendit\\n was the next question\\n for they would not send this byhim by whom they sent the first\\n for they thought that thePrince had taken some offence at the manner of his deportmentbefore him\\n so they attempted to make Captain Convictiontheir messenger with it\\n but he said that he neither durstnor would petition Emmanuel for traitors\\n nor be to thePrince an advocate for rebels\\n  \\'Yet withal\\n\\' said he\\n \\'ourPrince is good\\n and you may adventure to send it by the handof one of your town\\n provided he went with a rope about hishead\\n and pleaded nothing but mercy\\n\\'Well\\n they made\\n through fear\\n their delays as long as theycould\\n and longer than delays were good\\n but fearing at lastthe dangerousness of them\\n they thought\\n but with many afainting in their minds\\n to send their petition by Mr\\nDesires-awake\\n so they sent for Mr\\n Desires-awake\\n  Now hedwelt in a very mean cottage in Mansoul\\n and he came at hisneighbour\\'s request\\n  So they told him what they had done\\nand what they would do\\n concerning petitioning\\n and that theydid desire of him that he would go therewith to the Prince\\nThen said Mr\\n Desires-awake\\n \\'Why should not I do the best Ican to save so famous a town as Mansoul from deserveddestruction\\n\\'  They therefore delivered the petition to him\\nand told him how he must address himself to the Prince\\n andwished him ten thousand good speeds\\n  So he comes to thePrince\\'s pavilion\\n as the first\\n and asked to speak with hisMajesty\\n  So word was carried to Emmanuel\\n and the Princecame out to the man\\n  When Mr\\n Desires-awake saw the Prince\\nhe fell flat with his face to the ground\\n and cried out\\n \\'Ohthat Mansoul might live before thee\\n\\' and with that hepresented the petition\\n the which when the Prince had read\\nhe turned away for a while and wept\\n but refraining himself\\nhe turned again to the man\\n who all this while lay crying athis feet\\n as at the first\\n and said to him\\n \\'Go thy way tothy place\\n and I will consider of thy requests\\n\\'Now\\n you may think that they of Mansoul that had sent him\\nwhat with guilt\\n and what with fear lest their petitionshould be rejected\\n could not but look with many a long look\\nand that\\n too\\n with strange workings of heart\\n to see whatwould become of their petition\\n  At last they saw theirmessenger coming back\\n  So\\n when he was come\\n they asked himhow he fared\\n what Emmanuel said\\n and what was become of thepetition\\n  But he told them that he would be silent till hecame to the prison to my Lord Mayor\\n my Lord Willbewill\\n andMr\\n Recorder\\n  So he went forwards towards the prison-house\\nwhere the men of Mansoul lay bound\\n  But\\n oh\\n what amultitude flocked after\\n to hear what the messenger said\\nSo\\n when he was come\\n and had shown himself at the gate ofthe prison\\n my Lord Mayor himself looked as white as a clout\\nthe Recorder also did quake\\n  But they asked and said\\n \\'Come\\ngood sir\\n what did the great Prince say to you\\n\\'  Then saidMr\\n Desires-awake\\n \\'When I came to my Lord\\'s pavilion\\n Icalled\\n and he came forth\\n  So I fell prostrate at his feet\\nand delivered to him my petition\\n for the greatness of hisperson\\n and the glory of his countenance\\n would not suffer meto stand upon my legs\\n  Now\\n as he received the petition\\n Icried\\n \"Oh that Mansoul might live before thee\\n\"  So\\n whenfor a while he had looked thereon\\n he turned him about\\n andsaid to his servant\\n \"Go thy way to thy place again\\n and Iwill consider of thy requests\\n\"\\'  The messenger added\\nmoreover\\n and said\\n \\'The Prince to whom you sent me is such aone for beauty and glory\\n that whoso sees him must both loveand fear him\\n  I\\n for my part\\n can do no less\\n but I know notwhat will be the end of these things\\n\\'At this answer they were all at a stand\\n both they in prison\\nand they that followed the messenger thither to hear thenews\\n nor knew they what\\n or what manner of interpretation toput upon what the Prince had said\\n  Now\\n when the prison wascleared of the throng\\n the prisoners among themselves beganto comment upon Emmanuel\\'s words\\n  My Lord Mayor said\\n thatthe answer did not look with a rugged face\\n but Willbewillsaid that it betokened evil\\n and the Recorder\\n that it was amessenger of death\\n  Now\\n they that were left\\n and that stoodbehind\\n and so could not so well hear what the prisonerssaid\\n some of them catched hold of one piece of a sentence\\nand some on a bit of another\\n some took hold of what themessenger said\\n and some of the prisoners\\' judgment thereon\\nso none had the right understanding of things\\n  But youcannot imagine what work these people made\\n and what aconfusion there was in Mansoul now\\nFor presently they that had heard what was said flew aboutthe town\\n one crying one thing\\n and another the quitecontrary\\n and both were sure enough they told true\\n for theydid hear\\n they said\\n with their ears what was said\\n andtherefore could not be deceived\\n  One would say\\n \\'We must allbe killed\\n\\' another would say\\n \\'We must all be saved\\n\\' and athird would say that the Prince would not be concerned withMansoul\\n and a fourth\\n that the prisoners must be suddenlyput to death\\n  And\\n as I said\\n every one stood to it that hetold his tale the rightest\\n and that all others but he wereout\\n  Wherefore Mansoul had now molestation upon molestation\\nnor could any man know on what to rest the sole of his foot\\nfor one would go by now\\n and as he went\\n if he heard hisneighbour tell his tale\\n to be sure he would tell the quitecontrary\\n and both would stand in it that he told the truth\\nNay\\n some of them had got this story by the end\\n that thePrince did intend to put Mansoul to the sword\\n  And now itbegan to be dark\\n wherefore poor Mansoul was in sadperplexity all that night until the morning\\nBut\\n so far as I could gather by the best information that Icould get\\n all this hubbub came through the words that theRecorder said when he told them that\\n in his judgment\\n thePrince\\'s answer was a messenger of death\\n  It was this thatfired the town\\n and that began the fright in Mansoul\\n forMansoul in former times did use to count that Mr\\n Recorderwas a seer\\n and that his sentence was equal to the best oforators\\n and thus was Mansoul a terror to itself\\nAnd now did they begin to feel what were the effects ofstubborn rebellion\\n and unlawful resistance against theirPrince\\n  I say\\n they now began to feel the effects thereof byguilt and fear\\n that now had swallowed them up\\n and who moreinvolved in the one but they that were most in the other\\n towit\\n the chief of the town of Mansoul\\nTo be brief\\n when the fame of the fright was out of the town\\nand the prisoners had a little recovered themselves\\n theytake to themselves some heart\\n and think to petition thePrince for life again\\n  So they did draw up a third petition\\nthe contents whereof were these\\n-\\'Prince Emmanuel the Great\\n Lord of all worlds\\n and Master ofmercy\\n we\\n thy poor\\n wretched\\n miserable\\n dying town ofMansoul\\n do confess unto thy great and glorious Majesty thatwe have sinned against thy Father and thee\\n and are no moreworthy to be called thy Mansoul\\n but rather to be cast intothe pit\\n  If thou wilt slay us\\n we have deserved it\\n  If thouwilt condemn us to the deep\\n we cannot but say thou artrighteous\\n  We cannot complain whatever thou dost\\n or howeverthou carriest it towards us\\n  But\\n oh\\n let mercy reign\\n andlet it be extended to us\\n  Oh\\n let mercy take hold upon us\\nand free us from our transgressions\\n and we will sing of thymercy and of thy judgment\\n  Amen\\n\\'This petition\\n when drawn up\\n was designed to be sent to thePrince as the first\\n  But who should carry it\\n - that was thequestion\\n  Some said\\n \\'Let him do it that went with thefirst\\n\\' but others thought not good to do that\\n and thatbecause he sped no better\\n  Now\\n there was an old man in thetown\\n and his name was Mr\\n Good-Deed\\n a man that bare onlythe name\\n but had nothing of the nature of the thing\\n  Now\\nsome were for sending him\\n but the Recorder was by no meansfor that\\n  \\'For\\n\\' said he\\n \\'we now stand in need of\\n and arepleading for mercy\\n wherefore\\n to send our petition by a manof this name\\n will seem to cross the petition itself\\n  Shouldwe make Mr\\n Good-Deed our messenger\\n when our petition criesfor mercy\\n\\'Besides\\n\\' quoth the old gentleman\\n \\'should the Prince now\\nas he receives the petition\\n ask him\\n and say\\n \"What is thyname\\n\" as nobody knows but he will\\n and he should say\\n \"OldGood-Deed\\n\" what\\n think you\\n would Emmanuel say but this\\n\"Ay\\n is old Good-Deed yet alive in Mansoul\\n then let oldGood-Deed save you from your distresses\\n\"  And if he says so\\nI am sure we are lost\\n nor can a thousand of old Good-Deedssave Mansoul\\n\\'After the Recorder had given in his reasons why old Good-Deedshould not go with this petition to Emmanuel\\n the rest of theprisoners and chief of Mansoul opposed it also\\n and so oldGood-Deed was laid aside\\n and they agreed to send Mr\\nDesires-awake again\\n  So they sent for him\\n and desired himthat he would a second time go with their petition to thePrince\\n and he readily told them he would\\n  But they bid himthat in anywise he should take heed that in no word orcarriage he gave offence to the Prince\\n \\'For by doing so\\n forought we can tell\\n you may bring Mansoul into utterdestruction\\n\\' said they\\nNow Mr\\n Desires-awake\\n when he saw that he must go on thiserrand\\n besought that they would grant that Mr\\n Wet-Eyesmight go with him\\n  Now this Mr\\n Wet-Eyes was a nearneighbour of Mr\\n Desires\\n a poor man\\n a man of a brokenspirit\\n yet one that could speak well to a petition\\n so theygranted that he should go with him\\n  Wherefore\\n they addressthemselves to their business\\n Mr\\n Desires put a rope upon hishead\\n and Mr\\n Wet-Eyes went with his hands wringing together\\nThus they went to the Prince\\'s pavilion\\nNow\\n when they went to petition this third time\\n they werenot without thoughts that\\n by often coming\\n they might be aburden to the Prince\\n  Wherefore\\n when they were come to thedoor of his pavilion\\n they first made their apology forthemselves\\n and for their coming to trouble Emmanuel sooften\\n and they said\\n that they came not hither to-day forthat they delighted in being troublesome\\n or for that theydelighted to hear themselves talk\\n but for that necessitycaused them to come to his Majesty\\n  They could\\n they said\\nhave no rest day nor night because of their transgressionsagainst Shaddai and against Emmanuel\\n his Son\\n  They alsothought that some misbehaviour of Mr\\n Desires-awake the lasttime might give distaste to his Highness\\n and so cause thathe returned from so merciful a Prince empty\\n and withoutcountenance\\n  So\\n when they had made this apology\\n Mr\\nDesires-awake cast himself prostrate upon the ground\\n as atthe first\\n at the feet of the mighty Prince\\n saying\\n \\'Oh\\nthat Mansoul might live before thee\\n\\' and so he delivered hispetition\\n  The Prince then\\n having read the petition\\n turnedaside awhile as before\\n and coming again to the place wherethe petitioner lay on the ground\\n he demanded what his namewas\\n and of what esteem in the account of Mansoul\\n for thathe\\n above all the multitude in Mansoul\\n should be sent to himupon such an errand\\n  Then said the man to the Prince\\n \\'Ohlet not my Lord be angry\\n and why inquirest thou after thename of such a dead do - as I am\\n  Pass by\\n I pray thee\\n andtake not notice of who I am\\n because there is\\n as thou verywell knowest\\n so great a disproportion between me and thee\\nWhy the townsmen chose to send me on this errand to my Lordis best known to themselves\\n but it could not be for thatthey thought that I had favour with my Lord\\n  For my part\\n Iam out of charity with myself\\n who\\n then\\n should be in lovewith me\\n  Yet live I would\\n and so would I that my townsmenshould\\n and because both they and myself are guilty of greattransgressions\\n therefore they have sent me\\n and I am come intheir names to beg of my Lord for mercy\\n  Let it please thee\\ntherefore\\n to incline to mercy\\n but ask not what thy servantsare\\n\\'Then said the Prince\\n \\'And what is he that is become thycompanion in this so weighty a matter\\n\\'  So Mr\\n Desires toldEmmanuel that he was a poor neighbour of his\\n and one of hismost intimate associates\\n  \\'And his name\\n\\' said he\\n \\'may itplease your most excellent Majesty\\n is Wet-Eyes\\n of the townof Mansoul\\n I know that there are many of that name that arenaught\\n but I hope it will be no offence to my Lord that Ihave brought my poor neighbour with me\\n\\'Then Mr\\n Wet-Eyes fell on his face to the ground\\n and madethis apology for his coming with his neighbour to his Lord\\n-\\'O\\n my Lord\\n\\' quoth he\\n \\'what I am I know not myself\\n norwhether my name be feigned or true\\n especially when I beginto think what some have said\\n namely\\n That this name wasgiven me because Mr\\n Repentance was my father\\n  Good men havebad children\\n and the sincere do oftentimes beget hypocrites\\nMy mother also called me by this name from the cradle\\n butwhether because of the moistness of my brain\\n or because ofthe softness of my heart\\n I cannot tell\\n  I see dirt in mineown tears\\n and filthiness in the bottom of my prayers\\n  But Ipray thee (and all this while the gentleman wept) that thouwouldest not remember against us our transgressions\\n nor takeoffence at the unqualifiedness of thy servants\\n butmercifully pass by the sin of Mansoul\\n and refrain from theglorifying of thy grace no longer\\n\\'So at his bidding they arose\\n and both stood trembling beforehim\\n and he spake to them to this purpose\\n-\"The town of Mansoul hath grievously rebelled against myFather\\n in that they have rejected him from being their King\\nand did choose to themselves for their captain a liar\\n amurderer\\n and a runagate slave\\n  For this Diabolus\\n yourpretended prince\\n though once so highly accounted of by you\\nmade rebellion against my Father and me\\n even in our palaceand highest court there\\n thinking to become a prince andking\\n  But being there timely discovered and apprehended\\n andfor his wickedness bound in chains\\n and separated to the pitwith those that were his companions\\n he offered himself toyou\\n and you have received him\\n\\'Now this is\\n and for a long time hath been\\n a high affrontto my Father\\n wherefore my Father sent to you a powerful armyto reduce you to your obedience\\n  But you know how these men\\ntheir captains and their counsels\\n were esteemed of you\\n andwhat they received at your hand\\n  You rebelled against them\\nyou shut your gates upon them\\n you bid them battle\\n youfought them\\n and fought for Diabolus against them\\n  So theysent to my Father for more power\\n and I\\n with my men\\n arecome to subdue you\\n  But as you treated the servants\\n so youtreated their Lord\\n  You stood up in hostile manner againstme\\n you shut up your gates against me\\n you turned the deafear to me\\n and resisted as long as you could\\n but now I havemade a conquest of you\\n  Did you cry me mercy so long as youhad hopes that you might prevail against me\\n  But now I havetaken the town\\n you cry\\n but why did you not cry before\\n whenthe white flag of my mercy\\n the red flag of justice\\n and theblack flag that threatened execution\\n were set up to cite youto it\\n  Now I have conquered your Diabolus\\n you come to mefor favour\\n but why did you not help me against the mighty\\nYet I will consider your petition\\n and will answer it so aswill be for my glory\\n\\'Go\\n bid Captain Boanerges and Captain Conviction bring theprisoners out to me into the camp to-morrow\\n and say you toCaptain Judgment and Captain Execution\\n \"Stay you in thecastle\\n and take good heed to yourselves that you keep allquiet in Mansoul until you shall hear further from me\\n\"\\'  Andwith that he turned himself from them\\n and went into hisroyal pavilion again\\nSo the petitioners\\n having received this answer from thePrince\\n returned\\n as at the first\\n to go to their companionsagain\\n  But they had not gone far\\n but thoughts began to workin their minds that no mercy as yet was intended by thePrince to Mansoul\\n  So they went to the place where theprisoners lay bound\\n but these workings of mind about whatwould become of Mansoul had such strong power over them\\n thatby that they were come unto them that sent them\\n they werescarce able to deliver their message\\nBut they came at length to the gates of the town\\n (now thetownsmen with earnestness were waiting for their return\\n)where many met them\\n to know what answer was made to thepetition\\n  Then they cried out to those that were sent\\n \\'Whatnews from the Prince\\n and what hath Emmanuel said\\n\\'  But theysaid that they must\\n as afore\\n go up to the prison\\n and theredeliver their message\\n  So away they went to the prison\\n witha multitude at their heels\\n  Now\\n when they were come to thegates of the prison\\n they told the first part of Emmanuel\\'sspeech to the prisoners\\n to wit\\n how he reflected upon theirdisloyalty to his Father and himself\\n and how they had chosenand closed with Diabolus\\n had fought for him\\n hearkened tohim\\n and been ruled by him\\n but had despised him and his men\\nThis made the prisoners look pale\\n but the messengersproceeded and said\\n \\'He\\n the Prince\\n said\\n moreover\\n that yethe would consider your petition\\n and give such answer theretoas would stand with his glory\\n\\'  And as these words werespoken\\n Mr\\n Wet-Eyes gave a great sigh\\n  At this they wereall of them struck into their dumps\\n and could not tell whatto say\\n fear also possessed them in a marvellous manner\\n anddeath seemed to sit upon some of their eyebrows\\n  Now\\n therewas in the company a notable\\n sharp-witted fellow\\n a mean manof estate\\n and his name was old Inquisitive\\n  This man askedthe petitioners if they had told out every whit of whatEmmanuel said\\n and they answered\\n \\'Verily\\n no\\n\\'  Then saidInquisitive\\n \\'I thought so\\n indeed\\n  Pray\\n what was it morethat he said unto you\\n\\'  Then they paused awhile\\n but at lastthey brought out all\\n saying\\n \\'The Prince bade us bid CaptainBoanerges and Captain Conviction bring the prisoners down tohim to-morrow\\n and that Captain Judgment and CaptainExecution should take charge of the castle and town till theyshould hear further from him\\n  They said also that when thePrince had commanded them thus to do\\n he immediately turnedhis back upon them\\n and went into his royal pavilion\\nBut\\n oh\\n how this return\\n and specially this last clause ofit\\n that the prisoners must go out to the Prince into thecamp\\n brake all their loins in pieces\\n  Wherefore\\n with onevoice they set up a cry that reached up to the heavens\\n  Thisdone\\n each of the three prepared himself to die\\n (and theRecorder said unto them\\n \\'This was the thing that I feared\\n\\')for they concluded that to-morrow\\n by that the sun went down\\nthey should be tumbled out of the world\\n  The whole town alsocounted of no other\\n but that\\n in their time and order\\n theymust all drink of the same cup\\n  Wherefore the town ofMansoul spent that night in mourning\\n and sackcloth andashes\\n  The prisoners also\\n when the time was come for themto go down before the Prince\\n dressed themselves in mourningattire\\n with ropes upon their heads\\n  The whole town ofMansoul also showed themselves upon the wall\\n all clad inmourning weeds\\n if\\n perhaps\\n the Prince with the sightthereof might be moved with compassion\\n  But\\n oh\\n how thebusy-bodies that were in the town of Mansoul did now concernthemselves\\n  They did run here and there through the streetsof the town by companies\\n crying out as they ran intumultuous wise\\n one after one manner\\n and another the quitecontrary\\n to the almost utter distraction of Mansoul\\nWell\\n the time is come that the prisoners must go down to thecamp\\n and appear before the Prince\\n  And thus was the mannerof their going down\\n Captain Boanerges went with a guardbefore them\\n and Captain Conviction came behind\\n and theprisoners went down\\n bound in chains\\n in the midst\\n  So Isay\\n the prisoners went in the midst\\n and the guard went withflying colours behind and before\\n but the prisoners went withdrooping spirits\\nOr\\n more particularly\\n thus\\n The prisoners went down all inmourning\\n they put ropes upon themselves\\n they went on\\nsmiting themselves on the breasts\\n but durst not lift uptheir eyes to heaven\\n  Thus they went out at the gate ofMansoul\\n till they came into the midst of the Prince\\'s army\\nthe sight and glory of which did greatly heighten theiraffliction\\n  Nor could they now longer forbear\\n but cry outaloud\\n \\'O unhappy men\\n  O wretched men of Mansoul\\n\\'  Theirchains\\n still mixing their dolorous notes with the cries ofthe prisoners\\n made the noise more lamentable\\nSo\\n when they were come to the door of the Prince\\'s pavilion\\nthey cast themselves prostrate upon the place\\n then one wentin and told his Lord that the prisoners were come down\\n  ThePrince then ascended a throne of state\\n and sent for theprisoners in\\n who\\n when they came\\n did tremble before him\\nalso they covered their faces with shame\\n  Now\\n as they drewnear to the place where he sat\\n they threw themselves downbefore him\\n  Then said the Prince to the Captain Boanerges\\n\\'Bid the prisoners stand upon their feet\\n\\'  Then they stoodtrembling before him\\n and he said\\n \\'Are you the men thatheretofore were the servants of Shaddai\\n\\'  And they said\\n\\'Yes\\n Lord\\n yes\\n\\'  Then said the Prince again\\n \\'Are you themen that did suffer yourselves to be corrupted and defiled bythat abominable one\\n Diabolus\\n\\'  And they said\\n \\'We did morethan suffer it\\n Lord\\n for we chose it of our own mind\\n\\'  ThePrince asked further\\n saying\\n \\'Could you have been contentthat your slavery should have continued under his tyranny aslong as you had lived\\n\\'  Then said the prisoners\\n \\'Yes\\n Lord\\nyes\\n for his ways were pleasing to our flesh\\n and we weregrown aliens to a better state\\n\\' - \\'And did you\\n\\' said he\\n\\'when I came up against this town of Mansoul\\n heartily wishthat I might not have the victory over you\\n\\' - \\'Yes\\n Lord\\nyes\\n\\' said they\\n  Then said the Prince\\n \\'And what punishmentis it\\n think you\\n that you deserve at my hand\\n for these andother your high and mighty sins\\n\\' - And they said\\n \\'Bothdeath and the deep\\n Lord\\n for we have deserved no less\\n\\'  Heasked again if they had aught to say for themselves why thesentence\\n that they confessed that they had deserved\\n shouldnot be passed upon them\\n  And they said\\n \\'We can say nothing\\nLord\\n thou art just\\n for we have sinned\\n\\'  Then said thePrince\\n \\'And for what are those ropes on your heads\\n\\'  Theprisoners answered\\n \\'These ropes are to bind us withal to theplace of execution\\n if mercy be not pleasing in thy sight\\n\\'So he further asked if all the men in the town of Mansoulwere in this confession\\n as they\\n  And they answered\\n \\'Allthe natives\\n Lord\\n but for the Diabolonians that came intoour town when the tyrant got possession of us\\n we can saynothing for them\\n\\'Then the Prince commanded that a herald should be called\\n andthat he should\\n in the midst and throughout the camp ofEmmanuel\\n proclaim\\n and that with sound of trumpet\\n that thePrince\\n the Son of Shaddai\\n had\\n in his Father\\'s name\\n andfor his Father\\'s glory\\n gotten a perfect conquest and victoryover Mansoul\\n and that the prisoners should follow him\\n andsay Amen\\n  So\\n this was done as he had commanded\\n  Andpresently the music that was in the upper region soundedmelodiously\\n the captains that were in the camp shouted\\n andthe soldiers did sing songs of triumph to the Prince\\n thecolours waved in the wind\\n and great joy was everywhere\\n onlyit was wanting as yet in the hearts of the men of Mansoul\\nThen the Prince called for the prisoners to come and to standagain before him\\n and they came and stood trembling\\n  And hesaid unto them\\n \\'The sins\\n trespasses\\n iniquities\\n that you\\nwith the whole town of Mansoul\\n have from time to timecommitted against my Father and me\\n I have power andcommandment from my Father to forgive to the town of Mansoul\\nand do forgive you accordingly\\n\\'  And having so said\\n he gavethem\\n written in parchment\\n and sealed with seven seals\\n alarge and general pardon\\n commanding my Lord Mayor\\n my LordWillbewill\\n and Mr\\n Recorder\\n to proclaim and cause it to beproclaimed to-morrow\\n by that the sun is up\\n throughout thewhole town of Mansoul\\nMoreover\\n the Prince stripped the prisoners of their mourningweeds\\n and gave them beauty for ashes\\n the oil of joy formourning\\n and the garment of praise for the spirit ofheaviness\\nThen he gave to each of the three jewels of gold and preciousstones\\n and took away their ropes\\n and put chains of goldabout their necks\\n and ear-rings in their ears\\n  Now\\n theprisoners\\n when they did hear the gracious words of PrinceEmmanuel\\n and had beheld all that was done unto them\\n faintedalmost quite away\\n for the grace\\n the benefit\\n the pardon\\nwas sudden\\n glorious\\n and so big\\n that they were not able\\nwithout staggering\\n to stand up under it\\n  Yea\\n my LordWillbewill swooned outright\\n but the Prince stepped to him\\nput his everlasting arms under him\\n embraced him\\n kissed him\\nand bid him be of good cheer\\n for all should be performedaccording to his word\\n  He also did kiss\\n and embrace\\n andsmile upon the other two that were Willbewill\\'s companions\\nsaying\\n \\'Take these as further tokens of my love\\n favour\\n andcompassions to you\\n and I charge you that you\\n Mr\\n Recorder\\ntell in the town of Mansoul what you have heard and seen\\n\\'Then were their fetters broken to pieces before their faces\\nand cast into the air\\n and their steps were enlarged underthem\\n  Then they fell down at the feet of the Prince\\n andkissed his feet\\n and wetted them with tears\\n also they criedout with a mighty strong voice\\n saying\\n \\'Blessed be the gloryof the Lord from this place\\n\\'  So they were bid rise up\\n andgo to the town\\n and tell to Mansoul what the Prince had done\\nHe commanded also that one with a pipe and tabor should goand play before them all the way into the town of Mansoul\\nThen was fulfilled what they never looked for\\n and they weremade to possess that which they never dreamed of\\nThe Prince also called for the noble Captain Credence\\n andcommanded that he and some of his officers should marchbefore the noble men of Mansoul with flying colours into thetown\\n  He gave also unto Captain Credence a charge\\n thatabout that time that the Recorder did read the general pardonin the town of Mansoul\\n that at that very time he should withflying colours march in at Eye-gate with his ten thousands athis feet and that he should so go until he came by the highstreet of the town\\n up to the castle gates\\n and that himselfshould take possession thereof against his Lord came thither\\nHe commanded\\n moreover\\n that he should bid Captain Judgmentand Captain Execution to leave the stronghold to him\\n and towithdraw from Mansoul\\n and to return into the camp with speedunto the Prince\\nAnd now was the town of Mansoul also delivered from theterror of the first four captains and their men\\nWell\\n I told you before how the prisoners were entertained bythe noble Prince Emmanuel\\n and how they behaved themselvesbefore him\\n and how he sent them away to their home with pipeand tabor going before them\\n  And now you must think thatthose of the town that had all this while waited to hear oftheir death\\n could not but be exercised with sadness of mind\\nand with thoughts that pricked like thorns\\n  Nor could theirthoughts be kept to any one point\\n the wind blew with themall this while at great uncertainties\\n yea\\n their hearts werelike a balance that had been disquieted with a shaking hand\\nBut at last\\n as they with many a long look looked over thewall of Mansoul\\n they thought that they saw some returning tothe town\\n and thought again\\n Who should they be\\n too\\n  Whoshould they be\\n  At last they discerned that they were theprisoners\\n but can you imagine how their hearts weresurprised with wonder\\n specially when they perceived also inwhat equipage and with what honour they were sent home\\n  Theywent down to the camp in black\\n but they came back to thetown in white\\n they went down to the camp in ropes\\n they cameback in chains of gold\\n they went down to the camp with theirfeet in fetters\\n but came back with their steps enlargedunder them\\n they went also to the camp looking for death\\n butthey came back from thence with assurance of life\\n they wentdown to the camp with heavy hearts\\n but came back again withpipe and tabor playing before them\\n  So as soon as they werecome to Eye-gate\\n the poor and tottering town of Mansouladventured to give a shout\\n and they gave such a shout asmade the captains in the Prince\\'s army leap at the soundthereof\\n  Alas\\n for them\\n poor hearts\\n who could blame them\\nsince their dead friends were come to life again\\n for it wasto them as life from the dead to see the ancients of the townof Mansoul shine in such splendour\\n  They looked for nothingbut the axe and the block\\n but\\n behold\\n joy and gladness\\ncomfort and consolation\\n and such melodious notes attendingthem that was sufficient to make a sick man well\\nSo\\n when they came up\\n they saluted each other with\\n\\'Welcome\\n welcome\\n and blessed be he that has spared you\\n\\'They added also\\n \\'We see it is well with you\\n but how must itgo with the town of Mansoul\\n  And will it go well with thetown of Mansoul\\n\\' said they\\n  Then answered them the Recorderand my Lord Mayor\\n \\'Oh\\n tidings\\n glad tidings\\n good tidingsof good\\n and of great joy to poor Mansoul\\n\\'  Then they gaveanother shout\\n that made the earth to ring again\\n  Afterthis\\n they inquired yet more particularly how things went inthe camp\\n and what message they had from Emmanuel to thetown\\n  So they told them all passages that had happened tothem at the camp\\n and everything that the Prince did to them\\nThis made Mansoul wonder at the wisdom and grace of thePrince Emmanuel\\n  Then they told them what they had receivedat his hands for the whole town of Mansoul\\n and the Recorderdelivered it in these words\\n \\' PARDON\\n PARDON\\n PARDON forMansoul\\n and this shall Mansoul know to-morrow\\n\\'  Then hecommanded\\n and they went and summoned Mansoul to meettogether in the market-place to-morrow\\n then to hear theirgeneral pardon read\\nBut who can think what a turn\\n what a change\\n what analteration this hint of things did make in the countenance ofthe town of Mansoul\\n  No man of Mansoul could sleep thatnight for joy\\n in every house there was joy and music\\nsinging and making merry\\n telling and hearing of Mansoul\\'shappiness was then all that Mansoul had to do\\n and this wasthe burden of all their song\\n \\'Oh\\n more of this at the risingof the sun\\n more of this to-morrow\\n\\'  \\'Who thoughtyesterday\\n\\' would one say\\n \\'that this day would have beensuch a day to us\\n  And who thought\\n that saw our prisoners godown in irons\\n that they would have returned in chains ofgold\\n  Yea\\n they that judged themselves as they went to bejudged of their judge\\n were by his mouth acquitted\\n not forthat they were innocent\\n but of the Prince\\'s mercy\\n and senthome with pipe and tabor\\n  But is this the common custom ofprinces\\n Do they use to show such kind of favours totraitors\\n  No\\n this is only peculiar to Shaddai\\n and untoEmmanuel\\n his Son\\n\\'Now morning drew on apace\\n wherefore the Lord Mayor\\n the LordWillbewill\\n and Mr\\n Recorder came down to the market-place atthe time that the Prince had appointed\\n where the townsfolkwere waiting for them\\n and when they came\\n they came in thatattire\\n and in that glory that the Prince had put them intothe day before\\n and the street was lightened with theirglory\\n  So the Mayor\\n Recorder\\n and my Lord Willbewill drewdown to Mouth-gate\\n which was at the lower end of the market-place\\n because that of old time was the place where they usedto read public matters\\n  Thither\\n therefore\\n they came intheir robes\\n and their tabrets went before them\\n  Now\\n theeagerness of the people to know the full of the matter wasgreat\\nThen the Recorder stood up upon his feet\\n and\\n firstbeckoning with his hand for silence\\n he read out with a loudvoice the pardon\\n  But when he came to these words\\n \\'TheLord\\n the Lord God\\n merciful and gracious\\n pardoninginiquity\\n transgressions\\n and sins\\n and to them all manner ofsin and blasphemy shall be forgiven\\n\\' etc\\n\\n they could notforbear leaping for joy\\n  For this you must know\\n that therewas conjoined herewith every man\\'s name in Mansoul\\n also theseals of the pardon made a brave show\\nWhen the Recorder had made an end of reading the pardon\\n thetownsmen ran up upon the walls of the town\\n and leaped andskipped thereon for joy\\n and bowed themselves seven timeswith their faces toward Emmanuel\\'s pavilion\\n and shouted outaloud for joy\\n and said\\n \\'Let Emmanuel live for ever\\n\\'  Thenorder was given to the young men in Mansoul that they shouldring the bells for joy\\n  So the bells did ring\\n and thepeople sing\\n and the music go in every house in Mansoul\\nWhen the Prince had sent home the three prisoners of Mansoulwith joy\\n and pipe and tabor\\n he commanded his captains\\n withall the field officers and soldiers throughout his army\\n tobe ready in that morning\\n that the Recorder should read thepardon in Mansoul\\n to do his further pleasure\\n  So themorning\\n as I have showed\\n being come\\n just as the Recorderhad made an end of reading the pardon\\n Emmanuel commandedthat all the trumpets in the camp should sound\\n that thecolours should be displayed\\n half of them upon MountGracious\\n and half of them upon Mount Justice\\n  He commandedalso that all the captains should show themselves in alltheir harness\\n and that the soldiers should shout for joy\\nNor was Captain Credence\\n though in the castle\\n silent insuch a day\\n but he\\n from the top of the hold\\n showed himselfwith sound of trumpet to Mansoul and to the Prince\\'s camp\\nThus have I showed you the manner and way that Emmanuel tookto recover the town of Mansoul from under the hand and powerof the tyrant Diabolus\\nNow\\n when the Prince had completed these\\n the outwardceremonies of his joy\\n he again commanded that his captainsand soldiers should show unto Mansoul some feats of war\\n sothey presently addressed themselves to this work\\n  But oh\\nwith what agility\\n nimbleness\\n dexterity\\n and bravery didthese military men discover their skill in feats of war tothe now gazing town of Mansoul\\nThey marched\\n they counter-marched\\n they opened to the rightand left\\n they divided and subdivided\\n they closed\\n theywheeled\\n made good their front and rear with their right andleft wings\\n and twenty things more\\n with that aptness\\n andthen were all as the were again\\n that they took - yea\\nravished\\n the hearts that were in Mansoul to behold it\\n  Butadd to this\\n the handling of their arms\\n the managing oftheir weapons of war\\n were marvellously taking to Mansoul andme\\nWhen this action was over\\n the whole town of Mansoul came outas one man to the Prince in the camp to thank him\\n and praisehim for his abundant favour\\n and to beg that it would pleasehis grace to come unto Mansoul with his men\\n and there totake up their quarters for ever\\n and this they did in mosthumble manner\\n bowing themselves seven times to the groundbefore him\\n  Then said he\\n \\'All peace be to you\\n\\' So the towncame nigh\\n and touched with the hand the top of his goldensceptre\\n and they said\\n \\'Oh\\n that the Prince Emmanuel\\n withhis captains and men of war\\n would dwell in Mansoul for ever\\nand that his battering-rams and slings might be lodged in herfor the use and service of the Prince\\n and for the help andstrength of Mansoul\\n  For\\n\\' said they\\n \\'we have room forthee\\n we have room for thy men\\n we have also room for thyweapons of war\\n and a place to make a magazine for thycarriages\\n  Do it\\n Emmanuel\\n and thou shalt be King andCaptain in Mansoul for ever\\n  Yea\\n govern thou also accordingto all the desire of thy soul\\n and make thou governors andprinces under thee of thy captains and men of war\\n and wewill become thy servants\\n and thy laws shall be ourdirection\\n\\'They added\\n moreover\\n and prayed his Majesty to considerthereof\\n \\'for\\n\\' said they\\n \\'if now\\n after all this gracebestowed upon us\\n thy miserable town of Mansoul\\n thoushouldest withdraw\\n thou and thy captains\\n from us\\n the townof Mansoul will die\\n  Yea\\n\\' said they\\n \\'our blessed Emmanuel\\nif thou shouldest depart from us now\\n now thou hast done somuch good for us\\n and showed so much mercy unto us\\n what willfollow but that our joy will be as if it had not been\\n andour enemies will a second time come upon us with more ragethan at the first\\n  Wherefore\\n we beseech thee\\n O thou\\n thedesire of our eyes\\n and the strength and life of our poortown\\n accept of this motion that now we have made unto ourLord\\n and come and dwell in the midst of us\\n and let us bethy people\\n  Besides\\n Lord\\n we do not know but that to thisday many Diabolonians may be yet lurking in the town ofMansoul\\n and they will betray us\\n when thou shalt leave us\\ninto the hand of Diabolus again\\n and who knows what designs\\nplots\\n or contrivances have passed betwixt them about thesethings already\\n  Loath we are to fall again into his horriblehands\\n  Wherefore\\n let it please thee to accept of our palacefor thy place of residence\\n and of the houses of the best menin our town for the reception of thy soldiers and theirfurniture\\n\\'Then said the Prince\\n \\'If I come to your town\\n will yousuffer me further to prosecute that which is in mine heartagainst mine enemies and yours\\n - yea\\n will you help me insuch undertakings\\n\\'They answered\\n \\'We know not what we shall do\\n we did notthink once that we should have been such traitors to Shaddaias we have proved to be\\n  What\\n then\\n shall we say to ourLord\\n  Let him put no trust in his saints\\n let the Princedwell in our castle\\n and make of our town a garrison\\n let himset his noble captains and his warlike soldiers over us\\n yea\\nlet him conquer us with his love\\n and overcome us with hisgrace\\n and then surely shall he be but with us\\n and help us\\nas he was and did that morning that our pardon was read untous\\n  We shall comply with this our Lord\\n and with his ways\\nand fall in with his word against the mighty\\n\\'One word more\\n and thy servants have done\\n and in this willtrouble our Lord no more\\n  We know not the depth of thewisdom of thee\\n our Prince\\n  Who could have thought\\n that hadbeen ruled by his reason\\n that so much sweet as we do nowenjoy should have come out of those bitter trials wherewithwe were tried at the first\\n  But\\n Lord\\n let light go before\\nand let love come after\\n yea\\n take us by the hand\\n and leadus by thy counsels\\n and let this always abide upon us\\n thatall things shall be the best for thy servants\\n and come toour Mansoul\\n and do as it pleaseth thee\\n  Or\\n Lord\\n come toour Mansoul\\n do what thou wilt\\n so thou keepest us fromsinning\\n and makest us serviceable to thy Majesty\\n\\'Then said the Prince to the town of Mansoul again\\n \\'Go\\nreturn to your houses in peace\\n  I will willingly in thiscomply with your desires\\n I will remove my royal pavilion\\n Iwill draw up my forces before Eye-gate to-morrow\\n and so willmarch forwards into the town of Mansoul\\n  I will possessmyself of your castle of Mansoul\\n and will set my soldiersover you\\n yea\\n I will yet do things in Mansoul that cannot beparalleled in any nation\\n country\\n or kingdom under heaven\\n\\'Then did the men of Mansoul give a shout\\n and returned untotheir houses in peace\\n they also told to their kindred andfriends the good that Emmanuel had promised to Mansoul\\n  \\'Andto-morrow\\n\\' said they\\n \\'he will march into our town\\n and takeup his dwelling\\n he and his men\\n in Mansoul\\n\\'Then went out the inhabitants of the town of Mansoul withhaste to the green trees and to the meadows\\n to gather boughsand flowers\\n therewith to strew the streets against theirPrince\\n the Son of Shaddai\\n should come\\n they also madegarlands and other fine works to betoken how joyful theywere\\n and should be to receive their Emmanuel into Mansoul\\nyea\\n they strewed the street quite from Eye-gate to thecastle-gate\\n the place where the Prince should be\\n  They alsoprepared for his coming what music the town of Mansoul wouldafford\\n that they might play before him to the palace\\n hishabitation\\nSo\\n at the time appointed he makes his approach to Mansoul\\nand the gates were set open for him\\n there also the ancientsand elders of Mansoul met him to salute him with a thousandwelcomes\\n  Then he arose and entered Mansoul\\n he and all hisservants\\n  The elders of Mansoul did also go dancing beforehim till he came to the castle gates\\n  And this was themanner of his going up thither\\n- He was clad in his goldenarmour\\n he rode in his royal chariot\\n the trumpets soundedabout him\\n the colours were displayed\\n his ten thousands wentup at his feet\\n and the elders of Mansoul danced before him\\nAnd now were the walls of the famous town of Mansoul filledwith the tramplings of the inhabitants thereof\\n who went upthither to view the approach of the blessed Prince and hisroyal army\\n  Also the casements\\n windows\\n balconies\\n and topsof the houses\\n were all now filled with persons of all sorts\\nto behold how their town was to be filled with good\\nNow\\n when he was come so far into the town as to theRecorder\\'s house\\n he commanded that one should go to CaptainCredence\\n to know whether the castle of Mansoul was preparedto entertain his royal presence (for the preparation of thatwas left to that captain)\\n and word was brought that it was\\nThen was Captain Credence commanded also to come forth withhis power to meet the Prince\\n the which was\\n as he hadcommanded\\n done\\n and he conducted him into the castle\\n  Thisdone\\n the Prince that night did lodge in the castle with hismighty captains and men of war\\n to the joy of the town ofMansoul\\nNow\\n the next care of the townsfolk was\\n how the captains andsoldiers of the Prince\\'s army should be quartered among them\\nand the care was not how they should shut their hands ofthem\\n but how they should fill their houses with them\\n forevery man in Mansoul now had that esteem of Emmanuel and hismen that nothing grieved them more than because they were notenlarged enough\\n every one of them to receive the whole armyof the Prince\\n yea\\n they counted it their glory to be waitingupon them\\n and would\\n in those days\\n run at their biddinglike lackeys\\nAt last they came to this result\\n-1\\n That Captain Innocency should quarter at Mr\\n Reason\\'s\\n2\\n That Captain Patience should quarter at Mr\\n Mind\\'s\\n  ThisMr\\n Mind was formerly the Lord Willbewill\\'s clerk in time ofthe late rebellion\\n3\\n It was ordered that Captain Charity should quarter at Mr\\nAffection\\'s house\\n4\\n That Captain Good-Hope should quarter at my Lord Mayor\\'s\\nNow\\n for the house of the Recorder\\n himself desired\\n becausehis house was next to the castle\\n and because from him it wasordered by the Prince that\\n if need be\\n the alarm should begiven to Mansoul\\n - it was\\n I say\\n desired by him thatCaptain Boanerges and Captain Conviction should take up theirquarters with him\\n even they and all their men\\n5\\n As for Captain Judgment and Captain Execution\\n my LordWillbewill took them and their men to him\\n because he was torule under the Prince for the good of the town of Mansoulnow\\n as he had before under the tyrant Diabolus for the hurtand damage thereof\\n6\\n And throughout the rest of the town were quarteredEmmanuel\\'s forces\\n but Captain Credence\\n with his men\\n abodestill in the castle\\n  So the Prince\\n his captains\\n and hissoldiers\\n were lodged in the town of Mansoul\\nNow\\n the ancients and elders of the town of Mansoul thoughtthat they never should have enough of the Prince Emmanuel\\nhis person\\n his actions\\n his words\\n and behaviour\\n were sopleasing\\n so taking\\n so desirable to them\\n  Wherefore theyprayed him\\n that though the castle of Mansoul was his placeof residence\\n (and they desired that he might dwell there forever\\n) yet that he would often visit the streets\\n houses\\n andpeople of Mansoul\\n  \\'For\\n\\' said they\\n \\'dread Sovereign\\n thypresence\\n thy looks\\n thy smiles\\n thy words\\n are the life\\n andstrength\\n and sinews of the town of Mansoul\\n\\'Besides this\\n they craved that they might have\\n withoutdifficulty or interruption\\n continual access unto him\\n (sofor that very purpose he commanded that the gates shouldstand open\\n) that they might there see the manner of hisdoings\\n the fortifications of the place\\n and the royalmansion-house of the Prince\\nWhen he spake\\n they all stopped their mouths and gaveaudience\\n and when he walked\\n it was their delight to imitatehim in his goings\\nNow\\n upon a time\\n Emmanuel made a feast for the town ofMansoul\\n and upon the feasting-day the townsfolk were come tothe castle to partake of his banquet\\n and he feasted themwith all manner of outlandish food\\n - food that grew not inthe fields of Mansoul\\n nor in all the whole Kingdom ofUniverse\\n it was food that came from his Father\\'s court\\n  Andso there was dish after dish set before them\\n and they werecommanded freely to eat\\n  But still\\n when a fresh dish wasset before them\\n they would whisperingly say to each other\\n\\'What is it\\n\\' for they wist not what to call it\\n  They drankalso of the water that was made wine\\n and were very merrywith him\\n  There was music also all the while at the table\\nand man did eat angels\\' food\\n and had honey given him out ofthe rock\\n  So Mansoul did eat the food that was peculiar tothe court\\n yea\\n they had now thereof to the full\\nI must not forget to tell you\\n that as at this table therewere musicians\\n so they were not those of the country\\n noryet of the town of Mansoul\\n but they were the masters of thesongs that were sung at the court of Shaddai\\nNow\\n after the feast was over\\n Emmanuel was for entertainingthe town of Mansoul with some curious riddles of secretsdrawn up by his Father\\'s secretary\\n by the skill and wisdomof Shaddai\\n the like to these there is not in any kingdom\\nThese riddles were made upon the King Shaddai himself\\n andupon Emmanuel his Son\\n and upon his wars and doings withMansoul\\nEmmanuel also expounded unto them some of those riddleshimself\\n but\\n oh\\n how they were lightened\\n  They saw whatthey never saw\\n they could not have thought that suchrarities could have been couched in so few and such ordinarywords\\n  I told you before\\n whom these riddles did concern\\nand as they were opened\\n the people did evidently see it wasso\\n  Yea\\n they did gather that the things themselves were akind of a portraiture\\n and that of Emmanuel himself\\n for whenthey read in the scheme where the riddles were writ\\n andlooked in the face of the Prince\\n things looked so like theone to the other\\n that Mansoul could not forbear but say\\n\\'This is the lamb\\n this is the sacrifice\\n this is the rock\\nthis is the red cow\\n this is the door\\n and this is the way\\n\\'with a great many other things more\\nAnd thus he dismissed the town of Mansoul\\n  But can youimagine how the people of the corporation were taken withthis entertainment\\n  Oh\\n they were transported with joy\\n theywere drowned with wonderment\\n while they saw and understood\\nand considered what their Emmanuel entertained them withal\\nand what mysteries he opened to them\\n  And when they were athome in their houses\\n and in their most retired places\\n theycould not but sing of him and of his actions\\n  Yea\\n so takenwere the townsmen now with their Prince\\n that they would singof him in their sleep\\nNow\\n it was in the heart of the Prince Emmanuel to new-modelthe town of Mansoul\\n and to put it into such a condition asmight be most pleasing to him\\n and that might best stand withthe profit and security of the now flourishing town ofMansoul\\n  He provided also against insurrections at home\\n andinvasions from abroad\\n such love had he for the famous townof Mansoul\\nWherefore he first of all commanded that the great slingsthat were brought from his Father\\'s court\\n when he came tothe war of Mansoul\\n should be mounted\\n some upon thebattlements of the castle\\n some upon the towers\\n for therewere towers in the town of Mansoul\\n towers\\n new-built byEmmanuel since he came hither\\n  There was also an instrument\\ninvented by Emmanuel\\n that was to throw stones from thecastle of Mansoul\\n out at Mouth-gate\\n an instrument thatcould not be resisted\\n nor that would miss of execution\\nWherefore\\n for the wonderful exploits that it did when used\\nit went without a name\\n and it was committed to the care of\\nand to be managed by the brave captain\\n the Captain Credence\\nin case of war\\nThis done\\n Emmanuel called the Lord Willbewill to him\\n andgave him in commandment to take care of the gates\\n the wall\\nand towers in Mansoul\\n also the Prince gave him the militiainto his hand\\n and a special charge to withstand allinsurrections and tumults that might be made in Mansoulagainst the peace of our Lord the King\\n and the peace andtranquillity of the town of Mansoul\\n  He also gave him incommission\\n that if he found any of the Diabolonians lurkingin any corner of the famous town of Mansoul\\n he shouldforthwith apprehend them\\n and stay them\\n or commit them tosafe custody\\n that they may be proceeded against according tolaw\\nThen he called unto him the Lord Understanding\\n who was theold Lord Mayor\\n he that was put out of place when Diabolustook the town\\n and put him into his former office again\\n andit became his place for his lifetime\\n  He bid him also thathe should build him a palace near Eye-gate\\n and that heshould build it in fashion like a tower for defence\\n  He bidhim also that he should read in the Revelation of Mysteriesall the days of his life\\n that he might know how to performhis office aright\\nHe also made Mr\\n Knowledge the Recorder\\n not of contempt toold Mr\\n Conscience\\n who had been Recorder before\\n but forthat it was in his princely mind to confer upon Mr\\nConscience another employ\\n of which he told the old gentlemanhe should know more hereafter\\nThen he commanded that the image of Diabolus should be takendown from the place where it was set up\\n and that they shoulddestroy it utterly\\n beating it into powder\\n and casting itinto the wind without the town wall\\n and that the image ofShaddai\\n his Father\\n should be set up again\\n with his own\\nupon the castle gates\\n and that it should be more fairlydrawn than ever\\n forasmuch as both his Father and himselfwere come to Mansoul in more grace and mercy than heretofore\\nHe would also that his name should be fairly engraven uponthe front of the town\\n and that it should be done in the bestof gold\\n for the honour of the town of Mansoul\\nAfter this was done\\n Emmanuel gave out a commandment thatthose three great Diabolonians should be apprehended\\n namely\\nthe two late Lord Mayors\\n to wit\\n Mr\\n Incredulity\\n Mr\\nLustings\\n and Mr\\n Forget-Good\\n the Recorder\\n  Besides these\\nthere were some of them that Diabolus made burgesses andaldermen in Mansoul\\n that were committed to ward by the handof the now valiant and now right noble\\n the brave LordWillbewill\\nAnd these were their names\\n Alderman Atheism\\n Alderman Hard-Heart\\n and Alderman False-Peace\\n  The burgesses were\\n Mr\\n No-Truth\\n Mr\\n Pitiless\\n Mr\\n Haughty\\n with the like\\n  These werecommitted to close custody\\n and the gaoler\\'s name was Mr\\nTrue-Man\\n  This True-Man was one of those that Emmanuelbrought with him from his Father\\'s court when at the first hemade a war upon Diabolus in the town or Mansoul\\nAfter this\\n the Prince gave a charge that the threestrongholds that\\n at the command of Diabolus\\n theDiabolonians built in Mansoul\\n should be demolished andutterly pulled down\\n of which holds and their names\\n withtheir captains and governors\\n you read a little before\\n  Butthis was long in doing\\n because of the largeness of theplaces\\n and because the stones\\n the timber\\n the iron\\n and allrubbish\\n was to be carried without the town\\nWhen this was done\\n the Prince gave order that the Lord Mayorand aldermen of Mansoul should call a court of judicature forthe trial and execution of the Diabolonians in thecorporation now under the charge of Mr\\n True-Man\\n the gaoler\\nNow\\n when the time was come\\n and the court set\\n commandmentwas sent to Mr\\n True-Man\\n the gaoler\\n to bring the prisonersdown to the bar\\n  Then were the prisoners brought down\\npinioned and chained together\\n as the custom of the town ofMansoul was\\n  So\\n when they were presented

arethey not guilty\\nFOREMAN\\n  Guilty\\n my lord\\nCLERK\\n  Look to your prisoners\\n gaoler\\nThis was done in the morning\\n and in the afternoon theyreceived the sentence of death according to the law\\nThe gaoler\\n therefore\\n having received such a charge\\n putthem all in the inward prison\\n to preserve them there tillthe day of execution\\n which was to be the next day in themorning\\nBut now to see how it happened\\n one of the prisoners\\nIncredulity by name\\n in the interim betwixt the sentence andthe time of execution\\n brake prison and made his escape\\n andgets him away quite out of the town of Mansoul\\n and laylurking in such places and holes as he might\\n until he shouldagain have opportunity to do the town of Mansoul a mischieffor their thus handling of him as they did\\nNow when Mr\\n Trueman\\n the gaoler\\n perceived that he had losthis prisoner\\n he was in a heavy taking\\n because that prisonerwas\\n to speak on\\n the very worst of all the gang\\n whereforefirst he goes and acquaints my Lord Mayor\\n Mr\\n Recorder\\n andmy Lord Willbewill\\n with the matter\\n and to get of them anorder to make search for him throughout the town of Mansoul\\nSo an order he got\\n and search was made\\n but no such mancould now be found in all the town of Mansoul\\nAll that could be gathered was\\n that he had lurked a whileabout the outside of the town\\n and that here and there one orother had a glimpse of him as he did make his escape out ofMansoul\\n one or two also did affirm that they saw him withoutthe town\\n going apace quite over the plain\\n  Now when he wasquite gone\\n it was affirmed by one Mr\\n Did-see\\n that heranged all over dry places\\n till he met with Diabolus\\n hisfriend\\n and where should they meet one another but just uponHell-gate hill\\nBut oh\\n what a lamentable story did the old gentleman tell toDiabolus concerning what sad alteration Emmanuel had made inMansoul\\nAs\\n first\\n how Mansoul had\\n after some delays\\n received ageneral pardon at the hands of Emmanuel\\n and that they hadinvited him into the town\\n and that they had given him thecastle for his possession\\n  He said\\n moreover\\n that they hadcalled his soldiers into the town\\n coveted who should quarterthe most of them\\n they also entertained him with the timbrel\\nsong\\n and dance\\n  \\'But that\\n\\' said Incredulity\\n \\'which is thesorest vexation to me is\\n that he hath pulled down\\n O father\\nthy image\\n and set up his own\\n pulled down thy officers andset up his own\\n  Yea\\n and Willbewill\\n that rebel\\n who\\n onewould have thought\\n should never have turned from us\\n he isnow in as great favour with Emmanuel as ever he was withthee\\n  But\\n besides all this\\n this Willbewill has received aspecial commission from his master to search for\\n toapprehend\\n and to put to death all\\n and all manner ofDiabolonians that he shall find in Mansoul\\n yea\\n and thisWillbewill has taken and committed to prison already eight ofmy Lord\\'s most trusty friends in Mansoul\\n  Nay\\n further\\n myLord\\n with grief I speak it\\n they have been all arraigned\\ncondemned\\n and\\n I doubt\\n before this executed in Mansoul\\n  Itold my Lord of eight\\n and myself was the ninth\\n who shouldassuredly have drunk of the same cup\\n but that through craft\\nI\\n as thou seest\\n have made mine escape from them\\n\\'When Diabolus had heard this lamentable story\\n he yelled andsnuffed up the wind like a dragon\\n and made the sky to lookdark with his roaring\\n he also sware that he would try to berevenged on Mansoul for this\\n  So they\\n both he and his oldfriend Incredulity\\n concluded to enter into greatconsultation\\n how they might get the town of Mansoul again\\nNow\\n before this time\\n the day was come in which theprisoners in Mansoul were to be executed\\n  So they werebrought to the cross\\n and that by Mansoul\\n in most solemnmanner\\n for the Prince said that this should be done by thehand of the town of Mansoul\\n \\'that I may see\\n\\' said he\\n \\'theforwardness of my now redeemed Mansoul to keep my word\\n andto do my commandments\\n and that I may bless Mansoul in doingthis deed\\n  Proof of sincerity pleases me well\\n let Mansoultherefore first lay their hands upon these Diabolonians todestroy them\\n\\'So the town of Mansoul slew them\\n according to the word oftheir Prince\\n but when the prisoners were brought to thecross to die\\n you can hardly believe what troublesome workMansoul had of it to put the Diabolonians to death\\n for themen\\n knowing that they must die\\n and every of them havingimplacable enmity in their hearts to Mansoul\\n what did theybut took courage at the cross\\n and there resisted the men ofthe town of Mansoul\\n  Wherefore the men of Mansoul wereforced to cry out for help to the captains and men of war\\nNow the great Shaddai had a secretary in the town\\n and he wasa great lover of the men of Mansoul\\n and he was at the placeof execution also\\n so he\\n hearing the men of Mansoul cry outagainst the strugglings and unruliness of the prisoners\\n roseup from his place\\n and came and put his hands upon the handsof the men of Mansoul\\n  So they crucified the Diaboloniansthat had been a plague\\n a grief\\n and an offence to the townof Mansoul\\nNow\\n when this good work was done\\n the Prince came down tosee\\n to visit\\n and to speak comfortably to the men ofMansoul\\n and to strengthen their hands in such work\\n  And hesaid to them that\\n by this act of theirs he had proved them\\nand found them to be lovers of his person\\n observers of hislaws\\n and such as had also respect to his honour\\n  He said\\nmoreover\\n (to show them that they by this should not belosers\\n nor their town weakened by the loss of them\\n) that hewould make them another captain\\n and that of one ofthemselves\\n  And that this captain should be the ruler of athousand\\n for the good and benefit of the now flourishingtown of Mansoul\\nSo he called one to him whose name was Waiting\\n and bid him\\n\\'Go quickly up to the castle gate\\n and inquire there for oneMr\\n Experience\\n that waiteth upon that noble captain\\n theCaptain Credence\\n and bid him come hither to me\\n\\'  So themessenger that waited upon the good Prince Emmanuel went andsaid as he was commanded\\n  Now the young gentleman waswaiting to see the captain train and muster his men in thecastle yard\\n  Then said Mr\\n Waiting to him\\n \\'Sir\\n the Princewould that you should come down to his highness forthwith\\n\\'So he brought him down to Emmanuel\\n and he came and madeobeisance before him\\n  Now the men of the town knew Mr\\nExperience well\\n for he was born and bred in Mansoul\\n theyalso knew him to be a man of conduct\\n of valour\\n and a personprudent in matters\\n he was also a comely person\\n well-spoken\\nand very successful in his undertakings\\nWherefore the hearts of the townsmen were transported withjoy when they saw that the Prince himself was so taken withMr\\n Experience\\n that he would needs make him a captain over aband of men\\nSo with one consent they bowed the knee before Emmanuel\\n andwith a shout said\\n \\'Let Emmanuel live for ever\\n\\'  Then saidthe Prince to the young gentleman\\n whose name was Mr\\nExperience\\n \\'I have thought good to confer upon thee a placeof trust and honour in this my town of Mansoul\\n\\'  Then theyoung man bowed his head and worshipped\\n  \\'It is\\n\\' saidEmmanuel\\n \\'that thou shouldest be a captain\\n a captain over athousand men in my beloved town of Mansoul\\n\\'  Then said thecaptain\\n \\'Let the King live\\n\\'  So the Prince gave out ordersforthwith to the King\\'s secretary\\n that he should draw up forMr\\n Experience a commission to make him a captain over athousand men\\n  \\'And let it be brought to me\\n\\' said he\\n \\'thatI may set to my seal\\n\\'  So it was done as it was commanded\\nThe commission was drawn up\\n brought to Emmanuel\\n and he sethis seal thereto\\n  Then\\n by the hand of Mr\\n Waiting\\n he sentit away to the captain\\nNow as soon as the captain had received his commission\\n hesounded his trumpet for volunteers\\n and young men came to himapace\\n yea\\n the greatest and chief men in the town sent theirsons\\n to be listed under his command\\n  Thus CaptainExperience came under command to Emmanuel\\n for the good ofthe town of Mansoul\\n  He had for his lieutenant one Mr\\nSkilful\\n and for his cornet one Mr\\n Memory\\n  His underofficers I need not name\\n  His colours were the white coloursfor the town of Mansoul\\n and his scutcheon was the dead lionand dead bear\\n  So the Prince returned to his royal palaceagain\\nNow when he was returned thither\\n the elders of the town ofMansoul\\n to wit\\n the Lord Mayor\\n the Recorder\\n and the LordWillbewill\\n went to congratulate him\\n and in special way tothank him for his love\\n care\\n and the tender compassion whichhe showed to his ever-obliged town of Mansoul\\n  So after awhile\\n and some sweet communion between them\\n the townsmenhaving solemnly ended their ceremony\\n returned to their placeagain\\nEmmanuel also at this time appointed them a day wherein hewould renew their charter\\n yea\\n wherein he would renew andenlarge it\\n mending several faults therein\\n that Mansoul\\'syoke might be yet more easy\\n  And this he did without anydesire of theirs\\n even of his own frankness and noble mind\\nSo when he had sent for and seen their old one\\n he laid itby\\n and said\\n \\'Now that which decayeth and waxeth old isready to vanish away\\n\\'  He said\\n moreover\\n \\'The town ofMansoul shall have another\\n a better\\n a new one\\n more steadyand firm by far\\n\\'  An epitome hereof take as follows\\n-\\'Emmanuel\\n Prince of Peace\\n and a great lover of the town ofMansoul\\n I do in the name of my Father\\n and of mine ownclemency\\n give\\n grant\\n and bequeath to my beloved town ofMansoul\\n\\'First\\n  Free\\n full\\n and everlasting forgiveness of allwrongs\\n injuries\\n and offences done by them against myFather\\n me\\n their neighbour\\n or themselves\\n\\'Second\\n  I do give them the holy law and my testament\\n withall that therein is contained\\n for their everlasting comfortand consolation\\n\\'Third\\n  I do also give them a portion of the self-same graceand goodness that dwells in my Father\\'s heart and mine\\n\\'Fourth\\n  I do give\\n grant\\n and bestow upon them freely\\n theworld and what is therein\\n for their good\\n and they shallhave that power over them\\n as shall stand with the honour ofmy Father\\n my glory\\n and their comfort\\n yea\\n I grant them thebenefits of life and death\\n and of things present\\n and thingsto come\\n  This privilege no other city\\n town\\n or corporation\\nshall have\\n but my Mansoul only\\n\\'Fifth\\n  I do give and grant them leave\\n and free access tome in my palace at all seasons - to my palace above or below- there to make known their wants to me\\n and I give them\\nmoreover\\n a promise that I will hear and redress all theirgrievances\\n\\'Sixth\\n  I do give\\n grant to\\n and invest the town of Mansoulwith full power and authority to seek out\\n take\\n enslave\\n anddestroy all\\n and all manner of Diabolonians that at any time\\nfrom whencesoever\\n shall be found straggling in or about thetown of Mansoul\\n\\'Seventh\\n  I do further grant to my beloved town of Mansoul\\nthat they shall have authority not to suffer any foreigner\\nor stranger\\n or their seed\\n to be free in\\n and of the blessedtown of Mansoul\\n nor to share in the excellent privilegesthereof\\n  But that all the grants\\n privileges\\n and immunitiesthat I bestow upon the famous town of Mansoul\\n shall be forthose the old natives\\n and true inhabitants thereof\\n to them\\nI say\\n and to their right seed after them\\n\\'But all Diabolonians\\n of what sort\\n birth\\n country\\n orkingdom soever\\n shall be debarred a share therein\\n\\'So when the town of Mansoul had received at the hand ofEmmanuel their gracious charter\\n (which in itself isinfinitely more large than by this lean epitome is set beforeyou\\n) they carried it to audience\\n that is\\n to the marketplace\\n and there Mr\\n Recorder read it in the presence of allthe people\\n  This being done\\n it was had back to the castlegates\\n and there fairly engraven upon the doors thereof\\n andlaid in letters of gold\\n to the end that the town of Mansoul\\nwith all the people thereof\\n might have it always in theirview\\n or might go where they might see what a blessed freedomtheir Prince had bestowed upon them\\n that their joy might beincreased in themselves\\n and their love renewed to theirgreat and good Emmanuel\\nBut what joy\\n what comfort\\n what consolation\\n think you\\n didnow possess the hearts of the men of Mansoul\\n  The bellsrung\\n the minstrels played\\n the people danced\\n the captainsshouted\\n the colours waved in the wind\\n and the silvertrumpets sounded\\n and the Diabolonians now were glad to hidetheir heads\\n for they looked like them that had been longdead\\nWhen this was over\\n the Prince sent again for the elders ofthe town of Mansoul\\n and communed with them about a ministrythat he intended to establish among them\\n such a ministrythat might open unto them\\n and that might instruct them inthe things that did concern their present and future state\\n\\'For\\n\\' said he\\n \\'you\\n of yourselves\\n unless you have teachersand guides\\n will not be able to know\\n and\\n if not to know\\n tobe sure not to do the will of my Father\\n\\'At this news\\n when the elders of Mansoul brought it to thepeople\\n the whole town came running together\\n (for it pleasedthem well\\n as whatever the Prince now did pleased thepeople\\n) and all with one consent implored his Majesty thathe would forthwith establish such a ministry among them asmight teach them both law and judgment\\n statute andcommandment\\n that they might be documented in all good andwholesome things\\n  So he told them that he would grant themtheir requests\\n and would establish two among them\\n one thatwas of his Father\\'s court\\n and one that was a native ofMansoul\\n\\'He that is from the court\\n\\' said he\\n \\'is a person of no lessquality and dignity than my Father and I\\n and he is the LordChief Secretary of my Father\\'s house\\n for he is\\n and alwayshas been\\n the chief dictator of all my Father\\'s laws\\n aperson altogether well skilled in all mysteries\\n andknowledge of mysteries\\n as is my Father\\n or as myself is\\nIndeed he is one with us in nature\\n and also as to loving of\\nand being faithful to\\n and in the eternal concerns of thetown of Mansoul\\n\\'And this is he\\n\\' said the Prince\\n \\'that must be your chiefteacher\\n for it is he\\n and he only\\n that can teach youclearly in all high and supernatural things\\n  He\\n and heonly\\n it is that knows the ways and methods of my Father atcourt\\n nor can any like him show how the heart of my Fatheris at all times\\n in all things\\n upon all occasions\\n towardsMansoul\\n for as no man knows the things of a man but thatspirit of a man which is in him\\n so the things of my Fatherknows no man but this his high and mighty Secretary\\n  Nor canany\\n as he\\n tell Mansoul how and what they shall do to keepthemselves in the love of my Father\\n  He also it is that canbring lost things to your remembrance\\n and that can tell youthings to come\\n  This teacher\\n therefore\\n must of necessityhave the pre-eminence\\n both in your affections and judgment\\nbefore your other teacher\\n his personal dignity\\n theexcellency of his teaching\\n also the great dexterity that hehath to help you to make and draw up petitions to my Fatherfor your help\\n and to his pleasing\\n must lay obligations uponyou to love him\\n fear him\\n and to take heed that you grievehim not\\n\\'This person can put life and vigour into all he says\\n yea\\nand can also put it into your heart\\n  This person can makeseers of you\\n and can make you tell what shall be hereafter\\nBy this person you must frame all your petitions to my Fatherand me\\n and without his advice and counsel first obtained\\nlet nothing enter into the town or castle of Mansoul\\n forthat may disgust and grieve this noble person\\n\\'Take heed\\n I say\\n that you do not grieve this minister\\n forif you do\\n he may fight against you\\n and should he once bemoved by you to set himself against you in battle array\\n thatwill distress you more than if twelve legions should from myFather\\'s court be sent to make war upon you\\n\\'But\\n as I said\\n if you shall hearken unto him\\n and shalllove him\\n if you shall devote yourselves to his teaching\\n andshall seek to have converse\\n and to maintain communion withhim\\n you shall find him ten times better than is the wholeworld to any\\n yea\\n he will shed abroad the love of my Fatherin your hearts\\n and Mansoul will be the wisest\\n and mostblessed of all people\\n\\'Then did the Prince call unto him the old gentleman\\n whobefore had been the Recorder of Mansoul\\n Mr\\n Conscience byname\\n and told him\\n That\\n forasmuch as he was well skilled inthe law and government of the town of Mansoul\\n and was alsowell-spoken\\n and could pertinently deliver to them hisMaster\\'s will in all terrene and domestic matters\\n thereforehe would also make him a minister for\\n in\\n and to the goodlytown of Mansoul\\n in all the laws\\n statutes\\n and judgments ofthe famous town of Mansoul\\n  \\'And thou must\\n\\' said thePrince\\n \\'confine thyself to the teaching of moral virtues\\n tocivil and natural duties\\n but thou must not attempt topresume to be a revealer of those high and supernaturalmysteries that are kept close in the bosom of Shaddai\\n myFather\\n for those things knows no man\\n nor can any revealthem but my Father\\'s Secretary only\\n\\'Thou art a native of the town of Mansoul\\n but the LordSecretary is a native with my Father\\n wherefore\\n as thou hastknowledge of the laws and customs of the corporation\\n so heof the things and will of my Father\\n\\'Wherefore\\n O Mr\\n Conscience\\n although I have made thee aminister and a preacher to the town of Mansoul\\n yet as to thethings which the Lord Secretary knoweth\\n and shall teach tothis people\\n there thou must be his scholar and a learner\\neven as the rest of Mansoul are\\n\\'Thou must therefore\\n in all high and supernatural things\\n goto him for information and knowledge\\n for though there be aspirit in man\\n this person\\'s inspiration must give himunderstanding\\n  Wherefore\\n O thou Mr\\n Recorder\\n keep low andbe humble\\n and remember that the Diabolonians that kept nottheir first charge\\n but left their own standing\\n are now madeprisoners in the pit\\n  Be therefore content with thy station\\n\\'I have made thee my Father\\'s vicegerent on earth\\n in suchthings of which I have made mention before\\n and thou\\n takethou power to teach them to Mansoul\\n yea\\n and to impose themwith whips and chastisements\\n if they shall not willinglyhearken to do thy commandments\\n\\'And\\n Mr\\n Recorder\\n because thou art old\\n and through manyabuses made feeble\\n therefore I give thee leave and licenseto go when thou wilt to my fountain\\n my conduit\\n and there todrink freely of the blood of my grape\\n for my conduit dothalways run wine\\n  Thus doing\\n thou shalt drive from thineheart and stomach all foul\\n gross\\n and hurtful humours\\n  Itwill also lighten thine eyes\\n and will strengthen thy memoryfor the reception and keeping of all that the King\\'s mostnoble Secretary teacheth\\n\\'When the Prince had thus put Mr\\n Recorder (that once so was)into the place and office of a minister to Mansoul\\n and theman had thankfully accepted thereof\\n then did Emmanueladdress himself in a particular speech to the townsmenthemselves\\n\\'Behold\\n\\' said the Prince to Mansoul\\n \\'my love and caretowards you\\n I have added to all that is past\\n this mercy\\n toappoint you preachers\\n the most noble Secretary to teach youin all high and sublime mysteries\\n and this gentleman\\n\\'pointing to Mr\\n Conscience\\n \\'is to teach you in all thingshuman and domestic\\n for therein lieth his work\\n  He is not\\nby what I have said\\n debarred of telling to Mansoul anythingthat he hath heard and received at the mouth of the lord highSecretary\\n only he shall not attempt to presume to pretend tobe a revealer of those high mysteries himself\\n for thebreaking of them up\\n and the discovery of them to Mansoullieth only in the power\\n authority\\n and skill of the lordhigh Secretary himself\\n  Talk of them he may\\n and so may therest of the town of Mansoul\\n yea\\n and may\\n as occasion givesthem opportunity\\n press them upon each other for the benefitof the whole\\n  These things\\n therefore\\n I would have youobserve and do\\n for it is for your life\\n and the lengtheningof your days\\n\\'And one thing more to my beloved Mr\\n Recorder\\n and to allthe town of Mansoul\\n You must not dwell in\\n nor stay upon\\nanything of that which he hath in commission to teach you\\n asto your trust and expectation of the next world\\n (of the nextworld\\n I say\\n for I purpose to give another to Mansoul\\n whenthis with them is worn out\\n) but for that you must wholly andsolely have recourse to\\n and make stay upon his doctrine thatis your Teacher after the first order\\n  Yea\\n Mr\\n Recorderhimself must not look for life from that which he himselfrevealeth\\n his dependence for that must be founded in thedoctrine of the other preacher\\n  Let Mr\\n Recorder also takeheed that he receive not any doctrine\\n or point of doctrine\\nthat is not communicated to him by his Superior Teacher\\n noryet within the precincts of his own formal knowledge\\n\\'Now\\n after the Prince had thus settled things in the famoustown of Mansoul\\n he proceeded to give to the elders of thecorporation a necessary caution\\n to wit\\n how they shouldcarry it to the high and noble captains that he had\\n from hisFather\\'s court\\n sent or brought with him\\n to the famous townof Mansoul\\n\\'These captains\\n\\' said he\\n \\'do love the town of Mansoul\\n andthey are picked men\\n picked out of abundance\\n as men thatbest suit\\n and that will most faithfully serve in the wars ofShaddai against the Diabolonians\\n for the preservation of thetown of Mansoul\\n  \\'I charge you therefore\\n\\' said he\\n \\'O yeinhabitants of the now flourishing town of Mansoul\\n that youcarry it not ruggedly or untowardly to my captains\\n or theirmen\\n since\\n as I said\\n they are picked and choice men - menchosen out of many for the good of the town of Mansoul\\n  Isay\\n I charge you\\n that you carry it not untowardly to them\\nfor though they have the hearts and faces of lions\\n when atany time they shall be called forth to engage and fight withthe King\\'s foes\\n and the enemies of the town of Mansoul\\n yeta little discountenance cast upon them from the town ofMansoul will deject and cast down their faces\\n will weakenand take away their courage\\n  Do not\\n therefore\\n O mybeloved\\n carry it unkindly to my valiant captains andcourageous men of war\\n but love them\\n nourish them\\n succourthem\\n and lay them in your bosoms\\n and they will not onlyfight for you\\n but cause to fly from you all those theDiabolonians that seek\\n and will\\n if possible\\n be\\n your utterdestruction\\n\\'If\\n therefore\\n any of them should at any time be sick orweak\\n and so not able to perform that office of love\\n which\\nwith all their hearts\\n they are willing to do (and will doalso when well and in health)\\n slight them not\\n nor despisethem\\n but rather strengthen them and encourage them\\n thoughweak and ready to die\\n for they are your fence\\n and yourguard\\n your wall\\n your gates\\n your locks\\n and your bars\\n  Andalthough\\n when they are weak\\n they can do but little\\n butrather need to be helped by you\\n than that you should thenexpect great things from them\\n yet\\n when well\\n you know whatexploits\\n what feats and warlike achievements they are ableto do\\n and will perform for you\\n\\'Besides\\n if they be weak\\n the town of Mansoul cannot bestrong\\n if they be strong\\n then Mansoul cannot be weak\\n yoursafety\\n therefore\\n doth lie in their health\\n and in yourcountenancing them\\n  Remember\\n also\\n that if they be sick\\nthey catch that disease of the town of Mansoul itself\\n\\'These things I have said unto you because I love yourwelfare and your honour\\n observe\\n therefore\\n O my Mansoul\\n tobe punctual in all things that I have given in charge untoyou\\n and that not only as a town corporate\\n and so to yourofficers and guard\\n and guides in chief\\n but to you as youare a people whose well-being\\n as single persons\\n depends onthe observation of the orders and commandments of their Lord\\n\\'Next\\n O my Mansoul\\n I do warn you of that\\n of which\\nnotwithstanding that reformation that at present is wroughtamong you\\n you have need to be warned about\\n whereforehearken diligently unto me\\n  I am now sure\\n and you will knowhereafter\\n that there are yet of the Diabolonians remainingin the town of Mansoul\\n Diabolonians that are sturdy andimplacable\\n and that do already while I am with you\\n and thatwill yet more when I am from you\\n study\\n plot\\n contrive\\ninvent\\n and jointly attempt to bring you to desolation\\n andso to a state far worse than that of the Egyptian bondage\\nthey are the avowed friends of Diabolus\\n therefore look aboutyou\\n  They used heretofore to lodge with their Prince in theCastle\\n when Incredulity was the Lord Mayor of this town\\n butsince my coming hither\\n they lie more in the outsides andwalls\\n and have made themselves dens\\n and caves\\n and holes\\nand strongholds therein\\n  Wherefore\\n O Mansoul\\n thy work\\n asto this\\n will be so much the more difficult and hard\\n thatis\\n to take\\n mortify\\n and put them to death according to thewill of my Father\\n  Nor can you utterly rid yourselves ofthem\\n unless you should pull down the walls of your town\\n thewhich I am by no means willing you should\\n  Do you ask me\\nWhat shall we do then\\n  Why\\n be you diligent\\n and quit youlike men\\n observe their holes\\n find out their haunts\\n assaultthem\\n and make no peace with them\\n  Wherever they haunt\\nlurk\\n or abide\\n and what terms of peace soever they offeryou\\n abhor\\n and all shall be well betwixt you and me\\n  Andthat you may the better know them from those that are thenatives of Mansoul\\n I will give you this brief schedule ofthe names of the chief of them\\n and they are these thatfollow\\n- The Lord Fornication\\n the Lord Adultery\\n the LordMurder\\n the Lord Anger\\n the Lord Lasciviousness\\n the LordDeceit\\n the Lord Evil-Eye\\n Mr\\n Drunkenness\\n Mr\\n Revelling\\nMr\\n Idolatry\\n Mr\\n Witch-craft\\n Mr\\n Variance\\n Mr\\n Emulation\\nMr\\n Wrath\\n Mr\\n Strife\\n Mr\\n Sedition\\n and Mr\\n Heresy\\n  Theseare some of the chief\\n O Mansoul\\n of those that will seek tooverthrow thee for ever\\n  These\\n I say\\n are the skulkers inMansoul\\n but look thou well into the law of thy King\\n andthere thou shalt find their physiognomy\\n and such othercharacteristical notes of them\\n by which they certainly maybe known\\n\\'These\\n O my Mansoul\\n (and I would gladly that you shouldcertainly know it\\n) if they be suffered to run and rangeabout the town as they would\\n will quickly\\n like vipers\\n eatout your bowels\\n yea\\n poison your captains\\n cut the sinews ofyour soldiers\\n break the bars and bolts of your gates\\n andturn your now most flourishing Mansoul into a barren anddesolate wilderness\\n and ruinous heap\\n  Wherefore\\n that youmay take courage to yourselves to apprehend these villainswherever you find them\\n I give to you\\n my Lord Mayor\\n my LordWillbewill\\n and Mr\\n Recorder\\n with all the inhabitants of thetown of Mansoul\\n full power and commission to seek out\\n totake\\n and to cause to be put to death by the cross\\n all\\n andall manner of Diabolonians\\n when and wherever you shall findthem to lurk within\\n or to range without the walls of thetown of Mansoul\\n\\'I told you before that I had placed a standing ministryamong you\\n not that you have but these with you\\n for my firstfour captains who came against the master and lord of theDiabolonians that was in Mansoul\\n they can\\n and if need be\\nand if they be required\\n will not only privately inform\\n butpublicly preach to the corporation both good and wholesomedoctrine\\n and such as shall lead you in the way\\n  Yea\\n theywill set up a weekly\\n yea\\n if need be\\n a daily lecture inthee\\n O Mansoul\\n and will instruct thee in such profitablelessons\\n that\\n if heeded\\n will do thee good at the end\\n  Andtake good heed that you spare not the men that you have acommission to take and crucify\\n\\'Now\\n as I have set before your eyes the vagrants andrunagates by name\\n so I will tell you\\n that among yourselves\\nsome of them shall creep in to beguile you\\n even such aswould seem\\n and that in appearance are\\n very rife and hot forreligion\\n  And they\\n if you watch not\\n will do you amischief\\n such an one as at present you cannot think of\\n\\'These\\n as I said\\n will show themselves to you in another huethan those under description before\\n  Wherefore\\n Mansoul\\nwatch and be sober\\n and suffer not thyself to be betrayed\\n\\'When the Prince had thus far new modelled the town ofMansoul\\n and had instructed them in such matters as wereprofitable for them to know\\n then he appointed another day inwhich he intended\\n when the townsfolk came together\\n tobestow a further badge of honour upon the town of Mansoul\\n -a badge that should distinguish them from all the people\\nkindreds\\n and tongues that dwell in the kingdom of Universe\\nNow it was not long before the day appointed was come\\n andthe Prince and his people met in the King\\'s palace\\n wherefirst Emmanuel made a short speech unto them\\n and then didfor them as he had said\\n and unto them as he had promised\\n\\'My Mansoul\\n\\' said he\\n \\'that which I now am about to do\\n isto make you known to the world to be mine\\n and to distinguishyou also in your own eyes\\n from all false traitors that maycreep in among you\\n\\'Then he commanded that those that waited upon him should goand bring forth out of his treasury those white andglistening robes \\'that I\\n\\' said he\\n \\'have provided and laidup in store for my Mansoul\\n\\'  So the white garments werefetched out of his treasury\\n and laid forth to the eyes ofthe people\\n  Moreover\\n it was granted to them that theyshould take them and put them on\\n \\'according\\n\\' said he\\n \\'toyour size and stature\\n\\'  So the people were put into white\\ninto fine linen\\n white and clean\\nThen said the Prince unto them\\n \\'This\\n O Mansoul\\n is mylivery\\n and the badge by which mine are known from theservants of others\\n  Yea\\n it is that which I grant to allthat are mine\\n and without which no man is permitted to seemy face\\n  Wear them\\n therefore\\n for my sake\\n who gave themunto you\\n and also if you would be known by the world to bemine\\n\\'But now\\n can you think how Mansoul shone\\n  It was fair as thesun\\n clear as the moon\\n and terrible as an army with banners\\nThe Prince added further\\n and said\\n \\'No prince\\n potentate\\n ormighty one of Universe\\n giveth this livery but myself\\nbehold\\n therefore\\n as I said before\\n you shall be known by itto be mine\\n\\'And now\\n\\' said he\\n \\'I have given you my livery\\n let me giveyou also in commandment concerning them\\n and be sure that youtake good heed to my words\\n\\'First\\n  Wear them daily\\n day by day\\n lest you should atsometimes appear to others as if you were none of mine\\n\\'Second\\n  Keep them always white\\n for if they be soiled\\n itis dishonour to me\\n\\'Third\\n  Wherefore gird them up from the ground\\n and let themnot lag with dust and dirt\\n\\'Fourth\\n  Take heed that you lose them not\\n lest you walknaked\\n and they see your shame\\n\\'Fifth\\n  But if you should sully them\\n if you should defilethem\\n the which I am greatly unwilling you should\\n and theprince Diabolus will be glad if you would\\n then speed you todo that which is written in my law\\n that yet you may stand\\nand befall before me\\n and before my throne\\n  Also\\n this isthe way to cause that I may not leave you\\n nor forsake youwhile here\\n but may dwell in this town of Mansoul for ever\\n\\'And now was Mansoul\\n and the inhabitants of it\\n as the signetupon Emmanuel\\'s right hand\\n  Where was there now a town\\n acity\\n a corporation\\n that could compare with Mansoul\\n a townredeemed from the hand\\n and from the power of Diabolus\\n atown that the King Shaddai loved\\n and that he sent Emmanuelto regain from the Prince of the infernal cave\\n yea\\n a townthat Emmanuel loved to dwell in\\n and that he chose for hisroyal habitation\\n a town that he fortified for himself\\n andmade strong by the force of his army\\n  What shall I say\\nMansoul has now a most excellent Prince\\n golden captains andmen of war\\n weapons proved\\n and garments as white as snow\\nNor are these benefits to be counted little\\n but great\\n canthe town of Mansoul esteem them so\\n and improve them to thatend and purpose for which they are bestowed upon them\\nWhen the Prince had thus completed the modelling of the town\\nto show that he had great delight in the work of his handsand took pleasure in the good that he had wrought for thefamous and flourishing Mansoul\\n he commanded\\n and they sethis standard upon the battlements of the castle\\n  And then\\nFirst\\n  He gave them frequent visits\\n not a day now but theelders of Mansoul must come to him\\n or he to them\\n into hispalace\\n  Now they must walk and talk together of all thegreat things that he had done\\n and yet further promised todo\\n for the town of Mansoul\\n  Thus would he often do with theLord Mayor\\n my Lord Willbewill\\n and the honest subordinatepreacher Mr\\n Conscience\\n and Mr\\n Recorder\\n  But oh\\n howgraciously\\n how lovingly\\n how courteously\\n and tenderly didthis blessed Prince now carry it towards the town of Mansoul\\nIn all the streets\\n gardens\\n orchards\\n and other places wherehe came\\n to be sure the poor should have his blessing andbenediction\\n yea\\n he would kiss them\\n and if they were ill hewould lay hands on them\\n and make them well\\n  The captains\\nalso\\n he would daily\\n yea\\n sometimes hourly\\n encourage withhis presence and goodly words\\n  For you must know that asmile from him upon them would put more vigour\\n more life\\nand stoutness into them\\n than would anything else underheaven\\nThe Prince would now also feast them\\n and be with themcontinually\\n hardly a week would pass but a banquet must behad betwixt him and them\\n  You may remember that\\n some pagesbefore\\n we make mention of one feast that they had together\\nbut now to feast them was a thing more common\\n every day withMansoul was a feast-day now\\n  Nor did he\\n when they returnedto their places\\n send them empty away\\n either they must havea ring\\n a gold chain\\n a bracelet\\n a white stone\\n orsomething\\n so dear was Mansoul to him now\\n so lovely wasMansoul in his eyes\\nSecond\\n  When the elders and townsmen did not come to him\\n hewould send in much plenty of provision unto them\\n meat thatcame from court\\n wine and bread that were prepared for hisFather\\'s table\\n yea\\n such delicates would he send unto them\\nand therewith would so cover their table\\n that whoever saw itconfessed that the like could not be seen in any kingdom\\nThird\\n  If Mansoul did not frequently visit him as he desiredthey should\\n he would walk out to them\\n knock at their doors\\nand desire entrance\\n that amity might be maintained betwixtthem and him\\n if they did hear and open to him\\n as commonlythey would\\n if they were at home\\n then would he renew hisformer love\\n and confirm it too with some new tokens\\n andsigns of continued favour\\nAnd was it not now amazing to behold\\n that in that very placewhere sometimes Diabolus had his abode\\n and entertained hisDiabolonians to the almost utter destruction of Mansoul\\n thePrince of princes should sit eating and drinking with them\\nwhile all his mighty captains\\n men of war\\n trumpeters\\n withthe singing-men and singing-women of his Father\\n stood roundabout to wait upon them\\n  Now did Mansoul\\'s cup run over\\n nowdid her conduits run sweet wine\\n now did she eat the finestof the wheat\\n and drink milk and honey out of the rock\\n  Now\\nshe said\\n How great is his goodness\\n for since I found favourin his eyes\\n how honourable have I been\\nThe blessed Prince did also ordain a new officer in the town\\nand a goodly person he was\\n his name was Mr\\n God\\'s-Peace\\nthis man was set over my Lord Willbewill\\n my Lord Mayor\\n Mr\\nRecorder\\n the subordinate preacher\\n Mr\\n Mind\\n and over allthe natives of the town of Mansoul\\n  Himself was not a nativeof it\\n but came with the Prince Emmanuel from the court\\n  Hewas a great acquaintance of Captain Credence and CaptainGood-Hope\\n some say they were kin\\n and I am of that opiniontoo\\n  This man\\n as I said\\n was made governor of the town ingeneral\\n especially over the castle\\n and Captain Credence wasto help him there\\n  And I made great observation of it\\n thatso long as all things went in Mansoul as this sweet-naturedgentleman would\\n the town was in most happy condition\\n  Nowthere were no jars\\n no chiding\\n no interferings\\n nounfaithful doings in all the town of Mansoul\\n every man inMansoul kept close to his own employment\\n  The gentry\\n theofficers\\n the soldiers\\n and all in place observed theirorder\\n  And as for the women and children of the town\\n theyfollowed their business joyfully\\n they would work and sing\\nwork and sing\\n from morning till night\\n so that quite throughthe town of Mansoul now nothing was to be found but harmony\\nquietness\\n joy\\n and health\\n  And this lasted all that summer\\nBut there was a man in the town of Mansoul\\n and his name wasMr\\n Carnal-Security\\n this man did\\n after all this mercybestowed on this corporation\\n bring the town of Mansoul intogreat and grievous slavery and bondage\\n  A brief account ofhim and of his doings take as followeth\\n-When Diabolus at first took possession of the town ofMansoul\\n he brought thither\\n with himself\\n a great number ofDiabolonians\\n men of his own conditions\\n  Now among thesethere was one whose name was Mr\\n Self-Conceit\\n and a notablebrisk man he was\\n as any that in those days did possess thetown of Mansoul\\n  Diabolus\\n then\\n perceiving this man to beactive and bold\\n sent him upon many desperate designs\\n thewhich he managed better\\n and more to the pleasing of hislord\\n than most that came with him from the dens could do\\nWherefore\\n finding him so fit for his purpose\\n he preferredhim\\n and made him next to the great Lord Willbewill\\n of whomwe have written so much before\\n  Now the Lord Willbewillbeing in those days very well pleased with him\\n and with hisachievements\\n gave him his daughter\\n the Lady Fear-Nothing\\nto wife\\n  Now\\n of my Lady Fear-nothing\\n did this Mr\\n Self-Conceit beget this gentleman\\n Mr\\n Carnal-Security\\nWherefore\\n there being then in Mansoul those strange kinds ofmixtures\\n it was hard for them\\n in some cases\\n to find outwho were natives\\n who not\\n for Mr\\n Carnal-Security sprangfrom my Lord Willbewill by mother\\'s side\\n though he had forhis father a Diabolonian by nature\\nWell\\n this Carnal-Security took much after his father andmother\\n he was self-conceited\\n he feared nothing\\n he was alsoa very busy man\\n nothing of news\\n nothing of doctrine\\nnothing of alteration\\n or talk of alteration\\n could at anytime be on foot in Mansoul\\n but be sure Mr\\n Carnal-Securitywould be at the head or tail of it\\n but\\n to be sure\\n he woulddecline those that he deemed the weakest\\n and stood alwayswith them in his way of standing\\n that he supposed was thestrongest side\\nNow\\n when Shaddai the mighty\\n and Emmanuel his Son\\n made warupon Mansoul\\n to take it\\n this Mr\\n Carnal-Security was thenin town\\n and was a great doer among the people\\n encouragingthem in their rebellion\\n putting them upon hardeningthemselves in their resisting the King\\'s forces\\n but when hesaw that the town of Mansoul was taken\\n and converted to theuse of the glorious Prince Emmanuel\\n and when he also sawwhat was become of Diabolus\\n and how he was unroosted\\n andmade to quit the castle in the greatest contempt and scorn\\nand that the town of Mansoul was well lined with captains\\nengines of war\\n and men\\n and also provision\\n what doth he butslyly wheel about also\\n and as he had served Diabolus againstthe good Prince\\n so he feigned that he would serve the Princeagainst his foes\\nAnd having got some little smattering of Emmanuel\\'s things bythe end\\n being bold\\n he ventures himself into the company ofthe townsmen\\n any attempts also to chat among them\\n  Now heknew that the power and strength of the town of Mansoul wasgreat\\n and that it could not but be pleasing to the people\\nif he cried up their might and their glory\\n  Wherefore hebeginneth his tale with the power and strength of Mansoul\\nand affirmed that it was impregnable\\n now magnifying theircaptains and their slings\\n and their rams\\n then crying uptheir fortifications and strongholds\\n and\\n lastly\\n theassurances that they had from their Prince\\n that Mansoulshould be happy for ever\\n  But when he saw that some of themen of the town were tickled and taken with his discourse\\n hemakes it his business\\n and walking from street to street\\nhouse to house\\n and man to man\\n he at last brought Mansoul todance after his pipe\\n and to grow almost as carnally secureas himself\\n so from talking they went to feasting\\n and fromfeasting to sporting\\n and so to some other matters\\n  NowEmmanuel was yet in the town of Mansoul\\n and he wiselyobserved their doings\\n  My Lord Mayor\\n my Lord Willbewill\\nand Mr\\n Recorder were also all taken with the words of thistattling Diabolonian gentleman\\n forgetting that their Princehad given them warning before to take heed that they were notbeguiled with any Diabolonian sleight\\n he had further toldthem that the security of the now flourishing town of Mansouldid not so much lie in her present fortifications and force\\nas in her so using of what she had\\n as might oblige herEmmanuel to abide within her castle\\n  For the right doctrineof Emmanuel was\\n that the town of Mansoul should take heedthat they forgot not his Father\\'s love and his\\n also\\n thatthey should so demean themselves as to continue to keepthemselves therein\\n  Now this was not the way to do it\\nnamely\\n to fall in love with one of the Diabolonians\\n andwith such an one too as Mr\\n Carnal-Security was\\n and to beled up and down by the nose by him\\n they should have heardtheir Prince\\n feared their Prince\\n loved their Prince\\n andhave stoned this naughty pack to death\\n and took care to havewalked in the ways of their Prince\\'s prescribing\\n for thenshould their peace have been as a river\\n when theirrighteousness had been like the waves of the sea\\nNow when Emmanuel perceived that through the policy of Mr\\nCarnal-Security the hearts of the men of Mansoul were chilledand abated in their practical love to him\\nFirst\\n  He bemoans them\\n and\\n condoles their state with theSecretary\\n saying\\n \\'Oh that my people had hearkened unto me\\nand that Mansoul had walked in my ways\\n  I would have fedthem with the finest of the wheat\\n and with honey out of therock would I have sustained them\\n\\'  This done\\n he said in hisheart\\n \\'I will return to the court\\n and go to my place\\n tillMansoul shall consider and acknowledge their offence\\n\\'  Andhe did so\\n and the cause and manner of his going away fromthem was\\n that Mansoul declined him\\n as is manifest in theseparticulars\\n\\'1\\n They left off their former way of visiting him\\n they camenot to his royal palace as afore\\n\\'2\\n They did not regard\\n nor yet take notice\\n that he came orcame not to visit them\\n\\'3\\n The love-feasts that had wont to be between their Princeand them\\n though he made them still\\n and called them to them\\nyet they neglected to come to them\\n or to be delighted withthem\\n\\'4\\n They waited not for his counsels\\n but began to beheadstrong and confident in themselves\\n concluding that nowthey were strong and invincible\\n and that Mansoul was secure\\nand beyond all reach of the foe\\n and that her state mustneeds be unalterable for ever\\n\\'Now\\n as was said\\n Emmanuel perceiving that by the craft ofMr\\n Carnal-Security\\n the town of Mansoul was taken off fromtheir dependence upon him\\n and upon his Father by him\\n andset upon what by them was bestowed upon it\\n he first\\n as Isaid\\n bemoaned their state\\n then he used means to make themunderstand that the way that they went on in was dangerous\\nfor he sent my Lord High Secretary to them\\n to forbid themsuch ways\\n but twice when he came to them\\n he found them atdinner in Mr\\n Carnal-Security\\'s parlour\\n and perceiving alsothat they were not willing to reason about matters concerningtheir good\\n he took grief and went his way\\n the which when hehad told to the Prince Emmanuel\\n he took offence\\n and wasgrieved also\\n and so made provision to return to his Father\\'scourt\\nNow\\n the methods of his withdrawing\\n as I was saying before\\nwere thus\\n-\\'1\\n Even while he was yet with them in Mansoul\\n he kepthimself close\\n and more retired than formerly\\n\\'2\\n His speech was not now\\n if he came in their company\\n sopleasant and familiar as formerly\\n\\'3\\n Nor did he\\n as in times past\\n send to Mansoul\\n from histable\\n those dainty bits which he was wont to do\\n\\'4\\n Nor when they came to visit him\\n as now and then theywould\\n would he be so easily spoken with as they found him tobe in times past\\n  They might now knock once\\n yea\\n twice\\n buthe would seem not at all to regard them\\n whereas formerly atthe sound of their feet he would up and run\\n and meet themhalfway\\n and take them too\\n and lay them in his bosom\\n\\'But thus Emmanuel carried it now\\n and by this his carriage hesought to make them bethink themselves\\n and return to him\\nBut\\n alas\\n they did not consider\\n they did not know his ways\\nthey regarded not\\n they were not touched with these\\n nor withthe true remembrance of former favours\\n  Wherefore what doeshe but in private manner withdraw himself\\n first from hispalace\\n then to the gate of the town\\n and so away fromMansoul he goes\\n till they should acknowledge their offence\\nand more earnestly seek his face\\n  Mr\\n God\\'s-Peace also laiddown his commission\\n and would for the present act no longerin the town of Mansoul\\nThus they walked contrary to him\\n and he again\\n by way ofretaliation\\n walked contrary to them\\n  But\\n alas\\n by thistime they were so hardened in their way\\n and had so drunk inthe doctrine of Mr\\n Carnal-Security\\n that the departing oftheir Prince touched them not\\n nor was he remembered by themwhen gone\\n and so\\n of consequence\\n his absence not condoledby them\\nNow\\n there was a day wherein this old gentleman\\n Mr\\n Carnal-Security\\n did again make a feast for the town of Mansoul\\n andthere was at that time in the town one Mr\\n Godly-Fear\\n onenow but little set by\\n though formerly one of great request\\nThis man\\n old Carnal-Security\\n had a mind\\n if possible\\n togull\\n and debauch\\n and abuse\\n as he did the rest\\n andtherefore he now bids him to the feast with his neighbours\\nSo the day being come\\n they prepare\\n and he goes and appearswith the rest of the guests\\n and being all set at the table\\nthey did eat and drink\\n and were merry\\n even all but this oneman\\n for Mr\\n Godly-Fear sat like a stranger\\n and did neithereat nor was merry\\n  The which\\n when Mr\\n Carnal-Securityperceived\\n he presently addressed himself in a speech thus tohim\\n-\\'Mr\\n Godly-Fear\\n are you not well\\n  You seem to be ill ofbody or mind\\n or both\\n  I have a cordial of Mr\\n Forget-Good\\'smaking\\n the which\\n sir\\n if you will take a dram of\\n I hope itmay make you bonny and blithe\\n and so make you more fit forus\\n feasting companions\\n\\'Unto whom the good old gentleman discreetly replied\\n \\'Sir\\n Ithank you for all things courteous and civil\\n but for yourcordial I have no list thereto\\n  But a word to the natives ofMansoul\\n You\\n the elders and chief of Mansoul\\n to me it isstrange to see you so jocund and merry\\n when the town ofMansoul is in such woeful case\\n\\'Then said Mr\\n Carnal-Security\\n \\'You want sleep\\n good air\\n Idoubt\\n  If you please\\n lie down\\n and take a nap\\n and wemeanwhile will be merry\\n\\'Then said the good man as follows\\n \\'Sir\\n if you were notdestitute of an honest heart\\n you could not do as you havedone and do\\n\\'Then said Mr\\n Carnal-Security\\n \\'Why\\n\\'GODLY\\n  Nay\\n pray interrupt me not\\n  It is true the town ofMansoul was strong\\n and\\n with a PROVISO\\n impregnable\\n butyou\\n the townsmen\\n have weakened it\\n and it now liesobnoxious to its foes\\n  Nor is it a time to flatter\\n or besilent\\n it is you\\n Mr\\n Carnal-Security\\n that have wililystripped Mansoul\\n and driven her glory from her\\n you havepulled down her towers\\n you have broken down her gates\\n youhave spoiled her locks and bars\\nAnd now\\n to explain myself\\n from that time that my lords ofMansoul\\n and you\\n sir\\n grew so great\\n from that time theStrength of Mansoul has been offended\\n and now he is arisenand is gone\\n  If any shall question the truth of my words\\n Iwill answer him by this\\n and suchlike questions\\n  \\'Where isthe Prince Emmanuel\\n  When did a man or woman in Mansoul seehim\\n  When did you hear from him\\n or taste any of his daintybits\\n\\'  You are now a feasting with this Diabolonian monster\\nbut he is not your Prince\\n  I say\\n therefore\\n though enemiesfrom without\\n had you taken heed\\n could not have made a preyof you\\n yet since you have sinned against your Prince\\n yourenemies within have been too hard for you\\nThen said Mr\\n Carnal-Security\\n \\'Fie\\n fie\\n  Mr\\n Godly-Fear\\nfie\\n - will you never shake off your TIMOROUSNESS\\n  Are youafraid of being sparrow-blasted\\n  Who hath hurt you\\n  Behold\\nI am on your side\\n only you are for doubting\\n and I am forbeing confident\\n  Besides\\n is this a time to be sad in\\n  Afeast is made for mirth\\n why\\n then\\n do you now\\n to yourshame\\n and our trouble\\n break out into such passionatemelancholy language\\n when you should eat and drink\\n and bemerry\\n\\'Then said Mr\\n Godly-Fear again\\n \\'I may well be sad\\n forEmmanuel is gone from Mansoul\\n  I say again\\n he is gone\\n andyou\\n sir\\n are the man that has driven him away\\n yea\\n he isgone without so much as acquainting the nobles of Mansoulwith his going\\n and if that is not a sign of his anger\\n I amnot acquainted with the methods of godliness\\n\\'And now\\n my lords and gentlemen\\n for my speech is still toyou\\n your gradual declining from him did provoke himgradually to depart from you\\n the which he did for some time\\nif perhaps you would have been made sensible thereby\\n andhave been renewed by humbling yourselves\\n but when he sawthat none would regard\\n nor lay these fearful beginnings ofhis anger and judgment to heart\\n he went away from thisplace\\n and this I saw with mine eye\\n  Wherefore now\\n whileyou boast\\n your strength is gone\\n you are like the man thathad lost his locks that before did wave about his shoulders\\nYou may\\n with this lord of your feast\\n shake yourselves\\n andconclude to do as at other times\\n but since without him youcan do nothing\\n and he is departed from you\\n turn your feastinto a sigh\\n and your mirth into lamentation\\n\\'Then the subordinate preacher\\n old Mr\\n Conscience by name\\n hethat of old was Recorder of Mansoul\\n being startled at whatwas said\\n began to second it thus\\n-\\'Indeed\\n my brethren\\n\\' quoth he\\n \\'I fear that Mr\\n Godly-Feartells us true\\n I\\n for my part\\n have not seen my Prince a longseason\\n  I cannot remember the day\\n for my part\\n nor can Ianswer Mr\\n Godly-Fear\\'s question\\n  I doubt\\n I am afraid thatall is nought with Mansoul\\n\\'GODLY\\n  Nay\\n I know that you shall not find him in Mansoul\\nfor he is departed and gone\\n yea\\n and gone for the faults ofthe elders\\n and for that they rewarded his grace withunsufferable unkindness\\nThen did the subordinate preacher look as if he would falldown dead at the table\\n also all there present\\n except theman of the house\\n began to look pale and wan\\n  But having alittle recovered themselves\\n and jointly agreeing to believeMr\\n Godly-Fear and his sayings\\n they began to consult whatwas best to be done\\n (now Mr\\n Carnal-Security was gone intohis withdrawing-room\\n for he liked not such dumpish doings\\n)both to the man of the house for drawing them into evil\\n andalso to recover Emmanuel\\'s love\\nAnd\\n with that\\n that saying of their Prince came very hotinto their minds\\n which he had bidden them do to such as werefalse prophets that should arise to delude the town ofMansoul\\n  So they took Mr\\n Carnal-Security (concluding thathe must be he) and burned his house upon him with fire\\n forhe also was a Diabolonian by nature\\nSo when this was passed and over\\n they bespeed themselves tolook for Emmanuel their Prince\\n and they sought him\\n but theyfound him not\\n  Then were they more confirmed in the truth ofMr\\n Godly-Fear\\'s sayings\\n and began also severely to reflectupon themselves for their so vile and ungodly doings\\n forthey concluded now that it was through them that their Princehad left them\\nThen they agreed and went to my Lord Secretary\\n (him whombefore they refused to hear - him whom they had grieved withtheir doings\\n) to know of him\\n for he was a seer\\n and couldtell where Emmanuel was\\n and how they might direct a petitionto him\\n  But the Lord Secretary would not admit them to aconference about this matter\\n nor would admit them to hisroyal place of abode\\n nor come out to them to show them hisface or intelligence\\nAnd now was it a day gloomy and dark\\n a day of clouds and ofthick darkness with Mansoul\\n  Now they saw that they had beenfoolish\\n and began to perceive what the company and prattleof Mr\\n Carnal-Security had done\\n and what desperate damagehis swaggering words had brought poor Mansoul into\\n  But whatfurther it was likely to cost them they were ignorant of\\nNow Mr\\n Godly-Fear began again to be in repute with the menof the town\\n yea\\n they were ready to look upon him as aprophet\\nWell\\n when the Sabbath day was come\\n they went to hear theirsubordinate preacher\\n but oh\\n how he did thunder and lightenthis day\\n  His text was that in the prophet Jonah\\n \\'They thatobserve lying vanities forsake their own mercy\\n\\'  But therewas then such power and authority in that sermon\\n and such adejection seen in the countenances of the people that day\\nthat the like hath seldom been heard or seen\\n  The people\\nwhen sermon was done\\n were scarce able to go to their homes\\nor to betake themselves to their employs the week after\\n theywere so sermon-smitten\\n and also so sermon-sick by beingsmitten\\n that they knew not what to do\\nHe did not only show to Mansoul their sin\\n but did tremblebefore them\\n under the sense of his own\\n still crying out ofhimself\\n as he preached to them\\n \\'Unhappy man that I am\\n thatI should do so wicked a thing\\n  That I\\n a preacher\\n whom thePrince did set up to teach to Mansoul his law\\n should myselflive senseless and sottishly here\\n and be one of the firstfound in transgression\\n  This transgression also fell withinmy precincts\\n I should have cried out against the wickedness\\nbut I let Mansoul lie wallowing in it\\n until it had drivenEmmanuel from its borders\\n\\'  With these things he alsocharged all the lords and gentry of Mansoul\\n to the almostdistracting of them\\nAbout this time\\n also\\n there was a great sickness in the townof Mansoul\\n and most of the inhabitants were greatlyafflicted\\n  Yea\\n the captains also\\n and men of war\\n werebrought thereby to a languishing condition\\n and that for along time together\\n so that in case of an invasion\\n nothingcould to purpose now have been done\\n either by the townsmenor field officers\\n  Oh\\n how many pale faces\\n weak hands\\nfeeble knees\\n and staggering men were now seen to walk thestreets of Mansoul\\n  Here were groans\\n there pants\\n andyonder lay those that were ready to faint\\nThe garments\\n too\\n which Emmanuel had given them were but ina sorry case\\n some were rent\\n some were torn\\n and all in anasty condition\\n some also did hang so loosely upon them\\nthat the next bush they came at was ready to pluck them off\\nAfter some time spent in this sad and desolate condition\\n thesubordinate preacher called for a day of fasting\\n and tohumble themselves for being so wicked against the greatShaddai and his Son\\n  And he desired that Captain Boanergeswould preach\\n  So he consented to do it\\n and the day beingcome\\n and his text was this\\n \\'Cut it down\\n why cumbereth itthe ground\\n\\'  And a very smart sermon he made upon the place\\nFirst\\n he showed what was the occasion of the words\\n namely\\nbecause the fig-tree was barren\\n then he showed what wascontained in the sentence\\n namely\\n repentance\\n or utterdesolation\\n  He then showed\\n also\\n by whose authority thissentence was pronounced\\n and that was by Shaddai himself\\nAnd\\n lastly\\n he showed the reasons of the point\\n and thenconcluded his sermon\\n  But he was very pertinent in theapplication\\n insomuch that he made poor Mansoul tremble\\n  Forthis sermon\\n as well as the former\\n wrought much upon thehearts of the men of Mansoul\\n yea\\n it greatly helped to keepawake those that were roused by the preaching that wentbefore\\n  So that now throughout the whole town\\n there waslittle or nothing to be heard or seen but sorrow\\n andmourning\\n and woe\\nNow\\n after sermon\\n they got together and consulted what wasbest to be done\\n  \\'But\\n\\' said the subordinate preacher\\n \\'Iwill do nothing of mine own head\\n without advising with myneighbour Mr\\n Godly-Fear\\n  For if he had aforehand understoodmore of the mind of our Prince than we\\n I do not know but healso may have it now\\n even now we are turning again tovirtue\\n\\'So they called and sent for Mr\\n Godly-Fear\\n and he forthwithappeared\\n  Then they desired that he would further show hisopinion about what they had best to do\\n Then said the oldgentleman as followeth\\n \\'It is my opinion that this town ofMansoul should\\n in this day of her distress\\n draw up and sendan humble petition to their offended Prince Emmanuel\\n thathe\\n in his favour and grace\\n will turn again unto you\\n andnot keep anger for ever\\n\\'When the townsmen had heard this speech\\n they did\\n with oneconsent\\n agree to his advice\\n so they did presently draw uptheir request\\n and the next was\\n But who shall carry it\\n  Atlast they did all agree to send it by my Lord Mayor\\n  So heaccepted of the service\\n and addressed himself to hisjourney\\n and went and came to the court of Shaddai\\n whitherEmmanuel the Prince of Mansoul was gone\\n  But the gate wasshut\\n and a strict watch kept thereat\\n so that the petitionerwas forced to stand without for a great while together\\n  Thenhe desired that some would go into the Prince and tell himwho stood at the gate\\n and what his business was\\n  So onewent and told to Shaddai\\n and to Emmanuel his Son\\n that theLord Mayor of the town of Mansoul stood without at the gateof the King\\'s court\\n desiring to be admitted into thepresence of the Prince\\n the King\\'s Son\\n  He also told whatwas the Lord Mayor\\'s errand\\n both to the King and his SonEmmanuel\\n  But the Prince would not come down\\n nor admit thatthe gate should be opened to him\\n but sent him an answer tothis effect\\n \\'They have turned their back unto me\\n and nottheir face\\n but now in the time of their trouble they say tome\\n Arise\\n and save us\\n  But can they not now go to Mr\\nCarnal-Security\\n to whom they went when they turned from me\\nand make him their leader\\n their lord\\n and their protectionnow in their trouble\\n why now in their trouble do they visitme\\n since in their prosperity they went astray\\n\\'The answer made my Lord Mayor look black in the face\\n ittroubled\\n it perplexed\\n it rent him sore\\n  And now he beganagain to see what it was to be familiar with Diabolonians\\nsuch as Mr\\n Carnal-Security was\\n  When he saw that at court\\nas yet\\n there was little help to be expected\\n either forhimself or friends in Mansoul\\n he smote upon his breast\\n andreturned weeping\\n and all the way bewailing the lamentablestate of Mansoul\\nWell\\n when he was come within sight of the town\\n the eldersand chief of the people of Mansoul went out at the gate tomeet him\\n and to salute him\\n and to know how he sped atcourt\\n  But he told them his tale in so doleful a manner\\nthat they all cried out\\n and mourned\\n and wept\\n  Whereforethey threw ashes and dust upon their heads\\n and put sackclothupon their loins\\n and went crying out through the town ofMansoul\\n the which\\n when the rest of the townsfolk saw\\n theyall mourned and wept\\n  This\\n therefore\\n was a day of rebukeand trouble\\n and of anguish to the town of Mansoul\\n and alsoof great distress\\nAfter some time\\n when they had somewhat refrained themselves\\nthey came together to consult again what by them was yet tobe done\\n and they asked advice\\n as they did before\\n of thatreverend Mr\\n Godly-Fear\\n who told them that there was no waybetter than to do as they had done\\n nor would he that theyshould be discouraged at all with that they had met with atcourt\\n yea\\n though several of their petitions should beanswered with nought but silence or rebuke\\n \\'For\\n\\' said he\\n\\'it is the way of the wise Shaddai to make men wait and toexercise patience\\n and it should be the way of them in want\\nto be willing to stay his leisure\\nThen they took courage\\n and sent again and again\\n and again\\nand again\\n for there was not now one day\\n nor an hour thatwent over Mansoul\\'s head\\n wherein a man might not have metupon the road one or other riding post\\n sounding the hornfrom Mansoul to the court of the King Shaddai\\n and all withletters petitionary in behalf of\\n and for the Prince\\'s returnto Mansoul\\n  The road\\n I say\\n was now full of messengers\\ngoing and returning\\n and meeting one another\\n some from thecourt\\n and some from Mansoul\\n and this was the work of themiserable town of Mansoul\\n all that long\\n that sharp\\n thatcold and tedious winter\\nNow if you have not forgot\\n you may yet remember that I toldyou before\\n that after Emmanuel had taken Mansoul\\n yea\\n andafter that he had new modelled the town\\n there remained inseveral lurking places of the corporation many of the oldDiabolonians\\n that either came with the tyrant when heinvaded and took the town\\n or that had there\\n by reason ofunlawful mixtures\\n their birth and breeding\\n and bringing up\\nAnd their holes\\n dens\\n and lurking places were in\\n under\\n orabout the wall of the town\\n  Some of their names are the LordFornication\\n the Lord Adultery\\n the Lord Murder\\n the LordAnger\\n the Lord Lasciviousness\\n the Lord Deceit\\n the LordEvil-eye\\n the Lord Blasphemy\\n and that horrible villain\\n theold and dangerous Lord Covetousness\\n  These\\n as I told you\\nwith many more\\n had yet their abode in the town of Mansoul\\nand that after that Emmanuel had driven their prince Diabolusout of the castle\\nAgainst these the good Prince did grant a commission to theLord Willbewill and others\\n yea\\n to the whole town ofMansoul\\n to seek\\n take\\n secure\\n and destroy any or all thatthey could lay hands of\\n for that they were Diabolonians bynature\\n enemies to the Prince\\n and those that sought to ruinthe blessed town of Mansoul\\n  But the town of Mansoul did notpursue this warrant\\n but neglected to look after\\n toapprehend\\n to secure\\n and to destroy these Diabolonians\\nWherefore what do these villains but by degrees take courageto put forth their heads\\n and to show themselves to theinhabitants of the town\\n  Yea\\n and as I was told\\n some of themen of Mansoul grew too familiar with some of them\\n to thesorrow of the corporation\\n as you yet will hear more of intime and place\\nWell\\n when the Diabolonian lords that were left perceivedthat Mansoul had\\n through sinning\\n offended Emmanuel theirPrince\\n and that he had withdrawn himself and was gone\\n whatdo they but plot the ruin of the town of Mansoul\\n  So upon atime they met together at the hold of one Mr\\n Mischief\\n whowas also a Diabolonian\\n and there consulted how they mightdeliver up Mansoul into the hands of Diabolus again\\n  Nowsome advised one way\\n and some another\\n every man accordingto his own liking\\n  At last my Lord Lasciviousnesspropounded\\n whether it might not be best\\n in the first place\\nfor some of those that were Diabolonians in Mansoul\\n toadventure to offer themselves for servants to some of thenatives of the town\\n \\'for\\n\\' said he\\n \\'if they so do\\n andMansoul shall accept of them\\n they may for us\\n and forDiabolus our Lord\\n make the taking of the town of Mansoulmore easy than otherwise it will be\\n\\'  But then stood up theLord Murder\\n and said\\n \\'This may not be done at this time\\nfor Mansoul is now in a kind of a rage\\n because by ourfriend\\n Mr\\n Carnal-Security\\n she hath been once ensnaredalready\\n and made to offend against her Prince\\n and how shallshe reconcile herself unto her lord again\\n but by the headsof these men\\n  Besides\\n we know that they have in commissionto take and slay us wherever they shall find us\\n let us\\ntherefore\\n be wise as foxes\\n when we are dead\\n we can do themno hurt\\n but while we live\\n we may\\n\\'  Thus\\n when they hadtossed the matter to and fro\\n they jointly agreed that aletter should forthwith be sent away to Diabolus in theirname\\n by which the state of the town of Mansoul should beshowed him\\n and how much it is under the frowns of theirPrince\\n  \\'We may also\\n\\' said some\\n \\'let him know ourintentions\\n and ask of him his advice in the case\\n\\'So a letter was presently framed\\n the contents of which werethese\\n-\\'To our great lord\\n the Prince Diabolus\\n dwelling below inthe infernal cave\\n\\'O great father\\n and mighty Prince Diabolus\\n we\\n the trueDiabolonians yet remaining in the rebellious town of Mansoul\\nhaving received our beings from thee\\n and our nourishment atthy hands\\n cannot with content and quiet endure to behold\\n aswe do this day\\n how thou art dispraised\\n disgraced\\n andreproached among the inhabitants of this town\\n nor is thylong absence at all delightful to us\\n because greatly to ourdetriment\\n\\'The reason of this our writing unto our lord\\n is for that weare not altogether without hope that this town may become thyhabitation again\\n for it is greatly declined from its PrinceEmmanuel\\n and he is uprisen\\n and is departed from them\\n yea\\nand though they send\\n and send\\n and send\\n and send after himto return to them\\n yet can they not prevail\\n nor get goodwords from him\\n\\'There has been also of late\\n and is yet remaining\\n a verygreat sickness and fainting among them\\n and that not onlyupon the poorer sort of the town\\n but upon the lords\\ncaptains\\n and chief gentry of the place\\n (we only who are ofthe Diabolonians by nature remain well\\n lively\\n and strong\\n)so that through their great transgression on the one hand\\nand their dangerous sickness on the other\\n we judge they lieopen to thy hand and power\\n  If\\n therefore\\n it shall standwith thy horrible cunning\\n and with the cunning of the restof the princes with thee\\n to come and make an attempt to takeMansoul again\\n send us word\\n and we shall to our utmost powerbe ready to deliver it into thy hand\\n  Or if what we havesaid shall not by thy fatherhood be thought best and mostmeet to be done\\n send us thy mind in a few words\\n and we areall ready to follow thy counsel to the hazarding of ourlives\\n and what else we have\\n\\'Given under our hands the day and date above-written\\n aftera close consultation at the house of Mr\\n Mischief\\n who yet isalive and hath his place in our desirable town of Mansoul\\n\\'When Mr\\n Profane (for he was the carrier) was come with hisletter to Hell-Gate Hill\\n he knocked at the brazen gates forentrance\\n  Then did Cerberus\\n the porter\\n for he is thekeeper of that gate\\n open to Mr\\n Profane\\n to whom hedelivered his letter\\n which he had brought from theDiabolonians in Mansoul\\n  So he carried it in\\n and presentedit to Diabolus his lord\\n and said\\n \\'Tidings\\n my lord\\n fromMansoul\\n from our trusty friends in Mansoul\\n\\'Then came together from all places of the den Beelzebub\\nLucifer\\n Apollyon\\n with the rest of the rabblement there\\n tohear what news from Mansoul\\n  So the letter was broken up andread\\n and Cerberus he stood by\\n  When the letter was openlyread\\n and the contents thereof spread into all the corners ofthe den\\n command was given that\\n without let or stop\\n dead-man\\'s bell should be rung for joy\\n  So the bell was rung\\n andthe princes rejoiced that Mansoul was likely to come to ruin\\nNow\\n the clapper of the bell went\\n \\'The town of Mansoul iscoming to dwell with us\\n make room for the town of Mansoul\\n\\'This bell therefore they did ring\\n because they did hope thatthey should have Mansoul again\\nNow\\n when they had performed this their horrible ceremony\\nthey got together again to consult what answer to send totheir friends in Mansoul\\n and some advised one thing\\n andsome another\\n but at length\\n because the business requiredhaste\\n they left the whole business to the prince Diabolus\\njudging him the most proper lord of the place\\n  So he drew upa letter as he thought fit\\n in answer to what Mr\\n Profane hadbrought\\n and sent it to the Diabolonians that did dwell inMansoul\\n by the same hand that had brought theirs to him\\n andthese were the contents thereof\\n-\\'To our offspring\\n the high and mighty Diabolonians that yetdwell in the town of Mansoul\\n Diabolus\\n the great prince ofMansoul\\n wisheth a prosperous issue and conclusion of thosemany brave enterprises\\n conspiracies\\n and designs\\n that you\\nof your love and respect to

received\\n to our highest joyand content\\n your welcome letter\\n by the hand of our trustyMr\\n Profane\\n and to show how acceptable your tidings were\\n werang out our bell for gladness\\n for we rejoiced as much as wecould\\n when we perceived that yet we had friends in Mansoul\\nand such as sought our honour and revenge in the ruin of thetown of Mansoul\\n  We also rejoiced to hear that they are in adegenerated condition\\n and that they have offended theirPrince\\n and that he is gone\\n  Their sickness also pleasethus\\n as does also your health\\n might\\n and strength\\n  Glad alsowould we be\\n right horribly beloved\\n could we get this towninto our clutches again\\n  Nor will we be sparing of spendingour wit\\n our cunning\\n our craft\\n and hellish inventions tobring

we will come with more strength\\n andso lay far more fast hold than at the first we did\\n  Besides\\nit is the law of that Prince that now they own\\n that if weget them a second time\\n they shall be ours for ever\\n\\'Do you\\n therefore\\n our trusty Diabolonians\\n yet more pryinto\\n and endeavour to spy out the weakness of the town ofMansoul\\n  We also would that you yourselves do attempt

tempting them to doubt and despair\\n or\\n whether byblowing up of the town by the gunpowder of pride\\n and self-conceit\\n  Do you also\\n O ye brave Diabolonians\\n and true sonsof the pit\\n be always in a readiness to make a most hideousassault within\\n when we shall be ready to storm it without\\nNow speed you in your project\\n and we in our desires\\n to theutmost power of our gates\\n which is the wish of your greatDiabolus\\n Mansoul\\'s enemy\\n and him that trembles when hethinks of judgment to come\\n  All the blessings of the pit beupon you\\n and so we close up our letter\\n\\'Given at the pit\\'s mouth\\n by the joint consent of all theprinces of darkness\\n to be sent\\n to the force and power thatwe have yet remaining in Mansoul\\n by the hand of Mr\\n Profane\\nby me\\n Diabolus\\n\\'This letter\\n as was said\\n was sent to Mansoul\\n to theDiabolonians that yet remained there\\n and that yet inhabitedthe wall\\n from the dark dungeon of Diabolus\\n by the hand ofMr\\n Profane\\n by whom they also in Mansoul sent theirs to thepit\\n  Now\\n when this Mr\\n Profane had made his return\\n and wascome to Mansoul again\\n he went and came as he was wont to thehouse of Mr\\n Mischief\\n for there was the conclave\\n and theplace where the contrivers were met\\n  Now\\n when they saw thattheir messenger was returned safe and sound\\n they weregreatly gladded thereat\\n  Then he presented them with hisletter which he had brought from Diabolus for them\\n thewhich\\n when they had read and considered\\n did much augmenttheir gladness\\n  They asked him after the welfare of theirfriends\\n as how their Lord Diabolus\\n Lucifer\\n and Beelzebubdid\\n with the rest of those of the den\\n  To which thisProfane made answer\\n \\'Well\\n well\\n my lords\\n they are well\\neven as well as can be in their place\\n  They also\\n\\' said he\\n\\'did ring for joy at the reading of your letter\\n as you wellperceived by this when you read it\\n\\'Now\\n as was said\\n when they had read their letter\\n andperceived that it encouraged them in their work\\n they fell totheir way of contriving again\\n namely\\n how they mightcomplete their Diabolonian design upon Mansoul\\n  And thefirst thing that they agreed upon was to keep all things fromMansoul as close as they could\\n  \\'Let it not be known\\n letnot Mansoul be acquainted with what we design against it\\n\\'The next thing was\\n how\\n or by what means\\n they should try tobring to pass the ruin and overthrow of Mansoul\\n and one saidafter this manner\\n and another said after that\\n  Then stoodup Mr\\n Deceit\\n and said\\n \\'My right Diabolonian friends\\n ourlords\\n and the high ones of the deep dungeon\\n do propoundunto us these three ways\\n\\'1\\n Whether we had best to seek its ruin by making Mansoulloose and vain\\n\\'2\\n Or whether by driving them to doubt and despair\\n\\'3\\n Or whether by endeavouring to blow them up by thegunpowder of pride and self-conceit\\n\\'Now\\n I think\\n if we shall tempt them to pride\\n that may dosomething\\n and if we tempt them to wantonness\\n that may help\\nBut\\n in my mind\\n if we could drive them into desperation\\nthat would knock the nail on the head\\n for then we shouldhave them\\n in the first place\\n question the truth of the loveof the heart of their Prince towards them\\n and that willdisgust him much\\n  This\\n if it works well\\n will make themleave off quickly their way of sending petitions to him\\n thenfarewell earnest solicitations for help and supply\\n for thenthis conclusion lies naturally before them\\n \"As good donothing\\n as do to no purpose\\n\"\\'  So to Mr\\n Deceit theyunanimously did consent\\nThen the next question was\\n But how shall we do to bring thisour project to pass\\n and it was answered by the samegentleman - that this might be the best way to do it\\n \\'Evenlet\\n\\' quoth he\\n \\'so many of our friends as are willing toventure themselves for the promoting of their prince\\'s cause\\ndisguise themselves with apparel\\n change their names\\n and gointo the market like far country-men\\n and proffer to letthemselves for servants to the famous town of Mansoul\\n andlet them pretend to do for their masters as beneficially asmay be\\n for by so doing they may\\n if Mansoul shall hire them\\nin little time so corrupt and defile the corporation\\n thather now Prince shall be not only further offended with them\\nbut in conclusion shall spue them out of his mouth\\n  And whenthis is done\\n our prince Diabolus shall prey upon them withease\\n yea\\n of themselves they shall fall into the mouth ofthe cater\\n\\'This project was no sooner propounded\\n but was as highlyaccepted\\n and forward were all Diabolonians now to engage inso delicate an enterprise\\n but it was not thought fit thatall should do thus\\n wherefore they pitched upon two or three\\nnamely\\n the Lord Covetousness\\n the Lord Lasciviousness\\n andthe Lord Anger\\n  The Lord Covetousness called himself by thename of Prudent-Thrifty\\n the Lord Lasciviousness calledhimself by the name of Harmless-Mirth\\n and the Lord Angercalled himself by the name of Good-Zeal\\nSo upon a market-day they came into the market-place\\n threelusty fellows they were to look on\\n and they were clothed insheep\\'s russet\\n which was also now in a manner as white aswere the white robes of the men of Mansoul\\n  Now the mencould speak the language of Mansoul well\\n  So when they werecome into the market-place\\n and had offered to let themselvesto the townsmen\\n they were presently taken up\\n for they askedbut little wages\\n and promised to do their masters greatservice\\nMr\\n Mind hired Prudent-Thrifty\\n and Mr\\n Godly-Fear hiredGood-Zeal\\n  True\\n this fellow Harmless-Mirth did hang alittle in hand\\n and could not so soon get him a master as theothers did\\n because the town of Mansoul was now in Lent\\n butafter a while\\n because Lent was almost out\\n the LordWillbewill hired Harmless-Mirth to be both his waiting manand his lackey\\n and thus they got them masters\\n These villains now being got thus far into the houses of themen of Mansoul\\n quickly began to do great mischief therein\\nfor\\n being filthy\\n arch\\n and sly\\n they quickly corrupted thefamilies where they were\\n yea\\n they tainted their mastersmuch\\n especially this Prudent-Thrifty\\n and him they callHarmless-Mirth\\n  True\\n he that went under the visor of Good-Zeal\\n was not so well liked of his master\\n for he quicklyfound that he was but a counterfeit rascal\\n the which whenthe fellow perceived\\n with speed he made his escape from thehouse\\n or I doubt not but his master had hanged him\\nWell\\n when these vagabonds had thus far carried on theirdesign\\n and had corrupted the town as much as they could\\n inthe next place they considered with themselves at what timetheir prince Diabolus without\\n and themselves within thetown\\n should make an attempt to seize upon Mansoul\\n and theyall agreed upon this\\n that a market-day would be best forthat work\\n for why\\n  Then will the townsfolk be busy in theirways\\n and always take this for a rule\\n when people are mostbusy in the world\\n they least fear a surprise\\n  \\'We alsothen\\n\\' said they\\n \\'shall be able with less suspicion togather ourselves together for the work of our friends andlords\\n yea\\n and in such a day\\n if we shall attempt our work\\nand miss it\\n we may\\n when they shall give us the rout\\n thebetter hide ourselves in the crowd\\n and escape\\n\\'These things being thus far agreed upon by them\\n they wroteanother letter to Diabolus\\n and sent it by the hand to Mr\\nProfane\\n the contents of which were these\\n-\\'The lords of Looseness send to the great and high Diabolusfrom our dens\\n caves\\n holes\\n and strongholds\\n in and aboutthe wall of the town of Mansoul\\n greeting\\n\\'Our great lord\\n and the nourisher of our lives\\n Diabolus -how glad we were when we heard of your fatherhood\\'s readinessto comply with us\\n and help forward our design in ourattempts to ruin

togive us to continue to devise\\n contrive\\n and study the utterdesolation of Mansoul\\n that we are not solicitous about\\n forwe know right well that it cannot but be pleasing andprofitable to us to see our enemies\\n and them that seek ourlives\\n die at our feet\\n or fly before us\\n  We therefore arestill contriving\\n and that to the best of our cunning\\n tomake this work most facile and easy to your lordships\\n and tous\\n\\'First\\n we considered of that most hellishly cunning\\ncompacted\\n threefold project\\n that by you was propounded tous in your last\\n and have concluded\\n that though to blow themup with the gunpowder of pride would do well\\n and to do it bytempting them to be loose and vain will help on\\n yet tocontrive to bring them into the gulf of desperation\\n we thinkwill do best of all\\n  Now we\\n who are at your beck\\n havethought or two ways to do this\\n first we\\n for our parts\\n willmake them as vile as we can\\n and then you with us\\n at a timeappointed\\n shall be ready to fall upon them with the utmostforce\\n  And of all the nations that are at your whistle\\n wethink that an army of doubters may be the most likely toattack and overcome the town of Mansoul\\n  Thus shall weovercome these enemies\\n else the pit shall open her mouthupon them\\n and desperation shall thrust them down into it\\nWe have also\\n to effect this so much by us desired design\\nsent already three of our trusty Diabolonians among them\\nthey are disguised in garb\\n they have changed their names\\nand are now accepted of them\\n namely\\n Covetousness\\nLasciviousness\\n and Anger\\n  The name of Covetousness ischanged to Prudent-Thrifty\\n and him Mr\\n Mind has hired\\n andis almost become as bad as our friend\\n  Lasciviousness haschanged his name to Harmless-Mirth\\n and he is got to be theLord Willbewill\\'s lackey\\n but he has made his master verywanton\\n  Anger changed his name into Good-Zeal\\n and wasentertained by Mr\\n Godly-Fear\\n but the peevish old gentlemantook pepper in the nose\\n and turned our companion out of hishouse\\n  Nay\\n he has informed us since that he ran away fromhim\\n or else his old master had hanged him up for his labour\\n\\'Now these have much helped forward our work and design uponMansoul\\n for notwithstanding the spite and quarrelsome temperof the old gentleman last mentioned\\n the other two ply theirbusiness well\\n and are likely to ripen the work apace\\n\\'Our next project is\\n that it be concluded that you come uponthe town upon a market-day\\n and that when they are upon theheat of their business\\n for then\\n to be sure\\n they will bemost secure\\n and least think that an assault will be madeupon them\\n  They will also at such a time be less able todefend themselves\\n and to offend you in the prosecution ofour design\\n  And we your trusty (and we are sure yourbeloved) ones shall\\n when you shall make your furious assaultwithout\\n be ready to second the business within\\n  So shallwe\\n in all likelihood\\n be able to put Mansoul to utterconfusion\\n and to swallow them up before they can come tothemselves\\n  If your serpentine heads\\n most subtile dragons\\nand our highly esteemed lords can find out a better way thanthis\\n let us quickly know your minds\\n\\'To the monsters of the infernal cave\\n from the house of Mr\\nMischief in Mansoul\\n by the hand of Mr\\n Profane\\n\\'Now all the while that the raging runagates and hellishDiabolonians were thus contriving the ruin of the town ofMansoul\\n they (namely\\n the poor town itself) was in a sad andwoeful case\\n partly because they had so grievously offendedShaddai and his Son\\n and partly because that the enemiesthereby got strength within them afresh\\n and also because\\nthough they had by many petitions made suit to the PrinceEmmanuel\\n and to his Father Shaddai by him\\n for their pardonand favour\\n yet hitherto obtained they not one smile\\n butcontrariwise\\n through the craft and subtilty of the domesticDiabolonians\\n their cloud was made to grow blacker andblacker\\n and their Emmanuel to stand at further distance\\nThe sickness also did still greatly rage in Mansoul\\n bothamong the captains and the inhabitants of the town\\n and theirenemies only were now lively and strong\\n and likely to becomethe head\\n whilst Mansoul was made the tail\\nBy this time the letter last mentioned\\n that was written bythe Diabolonians that yet lurked in the town of Mansoul\\n wasconveyed to Diabolus in the black den\\n by the hand of Mr\\nProfane\\n  He carried the letter by Hell-Gate Hill as afore\\nand conveyed it by Cerberus to his lord\\nBut when Cerberus and Mr\\n Profane did meet\\n they werepresently as great as beggars\\n and thus they fell intodiscourse about Mansoul\\n and about the project against her\\n\\'Ah\\n old friend\\n\\' quoth Cerberus\\n \\'art thou come to Hell-GateHill again\\n  By St\\n Mary\\n I am glad to see thee\\n\\'PROF\\n  Yes\\n my lord\\n I am come again about the concerns ofthe town of Mansoul\\nCERB\\n  Prithee\\n tell me what condition is that town ofMansoul in at present\\nPROF\\n  In a brave condition\\n my lord\\n for us\\n and for mylords\\n the lords of this place\\n I trow for they are greatlydecayed as to godliness\\n and that is as well as our heart canwish\\n their Lord is greatly out with them\\n and that doth alsoplease us well\\n  We have already also a foot in their dish\\nfor our Diabolonian friends are laid in their bosoms\\n andwhat do we lack but to be masters of the place\\n  Besides\\n ourtrusty friends in Mansoul are daily plotting to betray it tothe lords of this town\\n also the sickness rages bitterlyamong them\\n and that which makes up all\\n we hope at last toprevail\\n\\'Then said the dog of Hell-Gate\\n \\'No time like this to assaultthem\\n  I wish that the enterprise be followed close\\n and thatthe success desired may be soon effected\\n yea\\n I wish it forthe poor Diabolonians\\' sakes\\n that live in the continual fearof their lives in that traitorous town of Mansoul\\n\\'PROF\\n  The contrivance is almost finished\\n the lords inMansoul that are Diabolonians are at it day and night\\n andthe other are like silly doves\\n they want heart to beconcerned with their state and to consider that ruin is athand\\n  Besides you may\\n yea\\n must think\\n when you put allthings together\\n that there are many reasons that prevailwith Diabolus to make what haste he can\\nCERB\\n  Thou hast said as it is\\n I am glad things are at thispass\\n  Go in\\n my brave Profane\\n to my lords\\n they will givethee for thy welcome as good a CORANTO as the whole of thiskingdom will afford\\n  I have sent thy letter in already\\nThen Mr\\n Profane went into the den\\n and his lord Diabolus methim\\n and saluted him with\\n \\'Welcome\\n my trusty servant\\n Ihave been made glad with thy letter\\n\\'  The rest of the lordsof the pit gave him also their salutations\\n  Then Profane\\nafter obeisance made to them all\\n said\\n \\'Let Mansoul be givento my lord Diabolus\\n and let him be her king for ever\\n\\'  Andwith that\\n the hollow belly and yawning gorge of hell gave soloud and hideous a groan\\n (for that is the music of thatplace\\n) that it made the mountains about it totter\\n as ifthey would fall in pieces\\nNow\\n after they had read and considered the letter\\n theyconsulted what answer to return\\n and the first that did speakto it was Lucifer\\nThen said he\\n \\'The first project of the Diabolonians inMansoul is likely to be lucky\\n and to take\\n namely\\n that theywill\\n by all the ways and means they can\\n make Mansoul yetmore vile and filthy\\n no way to destroy a soul like this\\nOur old friend Balaam went this way and prospered many yearsago\\n let this therefore stand with us for a maxim\\n and be toDiabolonians for a general rule in all ages\\n for nothing canmake this to fail but grace\\n in which I would hope that thistown has no share\\n  But whether to fall upon them on amarket-day\\n because of their cumber in business\\n that I wouldshould be under debate\\n  And there is more reason why thishead should be debated\\n than why some other should\\n becauseupon this will turn the whole of what we shall attempt\\n  Ifwe time not our business well\\n our whole project may fail\\nOur friends\\n the Diabolonians\\n say that a market-day is best\\nfor then will Mansoul be most busy\\n and have fewest thoughtsof a surprise\\n  But what if also they should double theirguards on those days\\n (and methinks nature and reason shouldteach them to do it\\n) and what if they should keep such awatch on those days as the necessity of their present casedoth require\\n yea\\n what if their men should be always in armson those days\\n then you may\\n my lords\\n be disappointed inyour attempts\\n and may bring our friends in the town to utterdanger of unavoidable ruin\\n\\'Then said the great Beelzebub\\n \\'There is something in what mylord hath said\\n but his conjecture may\\n or may not fall out\\nNor hath my lord laid it down as that which must not bereceded from\\n for I know that he said it only to provoke to awarm debate thereabout\\n  Therefore we must understand\\n if wecan\\n whether the town of Mansoul has such sense and knowledgeof her decayed state\\n and of the design that we have on footagainst her\\n as doth provoke her to set watch and ward at hergates\\n and to double them on market-days\\n  But if\\n afterinquiry made\\n it shall be found that they are asleep\\n thenany day will do\\n but a market-day is best\\n and this is myjudgment in this case\\n\\'Then quoth Diabolus\\n \\'How should we know this\\n\\' and it wasanswered\\n \\'Inquire about it at the mouth of Mr\\n Profane\\n\\'  SoProfane was called in\\n and asked the question\\n and he madehis answer as follows\\n-PROF\\n  My lords\\n so far as I can gather\\n this is at presentthe condition of the town of Mansoul\\n they are decayed intheir faith and love\\n Emmanuel\\n their Prince\\n has given themthe back\\n they send often by petition to fetch him again\\n buthe maketh not haste to answer their request\\n nor is theremuch reformation among them\\nDIAB\\n  I am glad that they are backward in a reformation\\n butyet I am afraid of their petitioning\\n  However\\n theirlooseness of life is a sign that there is not much heart inwhat they do\\n and without the heart things are little worth\\nBut go on\\n my masters\\n I will divert you\\n my lords\\n nolonger\\nBEEL\\n  If the case be so with Mansoul\\n as Mr\\n Profane hasdescribed it to be\\n it will be no great matter what day weassault it\\n not their prayers\\n nor their power will do themmuch service\\nWhen Beelzebub had ended his oration\\n then Apollyon didbegin\\n  \\'My opinion\\n\\' said he\\n \\'concerning this matter\\n is\\nthat we go on fair and softly\\n not doing things in a hurry\\nLet our friends in Mansoul go on still to pollute and defileit\\n by seeking to draw it yet more into sin (for there isnothing like sin to devour Mansoul)\\n  If this be done\\n and ittakes effect\\n Mansoul\\n of itself\\n will leave off to watch\\n topetition\\n or anything else that should tend to her securityand safety\\n for she will forget her Emmanuel\\n she will notdesire his company\\n and can she be gotten thus to live\\n herPrince will not come to her in haste\\n  Our trusty friend\\n Mr\\nCarnal-Security\\n with one of his tricks did drive him out ofthe town\\n and why may not my Lord Covetousness\\n and my LordLasciviousness\\n by what they may do\\n keep him out of thetown\\n  And this I will tell you\\n (not because you know itnot\\n) that two or three Diabolonians\\n if entertained andcountenanced by the town of Mansoul\\n will do more to thekeeping of Emmanuel from them\\n and towards making the town ofMansoul your own\\n than can an army of a legion that should besent out from us to withstand him\\n  Let\\n therefore\\n thisfirst project that our friends in Mansoul have set on foot\\nbe strongly and diligently carried on\\n with all cunning andcraft imaginable\\n and let them send continually\\n under oneguise or another\\n more and other of their men to play withthe people of Mansoul\\n and then\\n perhaps\\n we shall not needto be at the charge of making a war upon them\\n or if thatmust of necessity be done\\n yet the more sinful they are\\n themore unable\\n to be sure\\n they will be to resist us\\n and thenthe more easily we shall overcome them\\n  And besides\\n suppose(and that is the worst that can be supposed) that Emmanuelshould come to them again\\n why may not the same means\\n or thelike\\n drive him from them once more\\n  Yea\\n why may he not\\n bytheir lapse into that sin again\\n be driven from them forever\\n for the sake of which he was at the first driven fromthem for a season\\n  And if this should happen\\n then away gowith him his rams\\n his slings\\n his captains\\n his soldiers\\nand he leaveth Mansoul naked and bare\\n  Yea\\n will not thistown\\n when she sees herself utterly forsaken of her Prince\\nof her own accord open her gates again unto you\\n and make ofyou as in the days of old\\n  But this must be done by time\\n afew days will not effect so great a work as this\\n\\'So soon as Apollyon had made an end of speaking\\n Diabolusbegan to blow out his own malice\\n and to plead his own cause\\nand he said\\n \\'My lords\\n and powers of the cave\\n my true andtrusty friends\\n I have with much impatience\\n as becomes me\\ngiven ear to your long and tedious orations\\n  But my furiousgorge\\n and empty paunch\\n so lusteth after a repossession ofmy famous town of Mansoul\\n that whatever comes out\\n I canwait no longer to see the events of lingering projects\\n  Imust\\n and that without further delay\\n seek\\n by all means Ican\\n to fill my insatiable gulf with the soul and body of thetown of Mansoul\\n  Therefore lend me your heads\\n your hearts\\nand your help\\n now I am going to recover my town of Mansoul\\n\\'When the lords and princes of the pit saw the flaming desirethat was in Diabolus to devour the miserable town of Mansoul\\nthey left off to raise any more objections\\n but consented tolend him what strength they could\\n though had Apollyon\\'sadvice been taken\\n they had far more fearfully distressed thetown of Mansoul\\n  But\\n I say\\n they were willing to lend himwhat strength they could\\n not knowing what need they mighthave of him\\n when they should engage for themselves\\n as he\\nWherefore they fell to advising about the next thingpropounded\\n namely\\n what soldiers they were\\n and also howmany\\n with whom Diabolus should go against the town ofMansoul to take it\\n and after some debate\\n it was concluded\\naccording as in the letter the Diabolonians had suggested\\nthat none were more fit for that expedition than an army ofterrible doubters\\n  They therefore concluded to send againstMansoul an army of sturdy doubters\\n  The number thought fitto be employed in that service was between twenty and thirtythousand\\n  So then the result of that great council of thosehigh and mighty lords was - That Diabolus should even now\\nout of hand\\n beat up his drum for men in the land ofDoubting\\n which land lieth upon the confines of the placecalled Hell-Gate Hill\\n for men that might be employed by himagainst the miserable town of Mansoul\\n  It was alsoconcluded\\n that these lords themselves should help him in thewar\\n and that they would to that end head and manage his men\\nSo they drew up a letter\\n and sent back to the Diaboloniansthat lurked in Mansoul\\n and that waited for the back-comingof Mr\\n Profane\\n to signify to them into what method andforwardness they at present had put their design\\n  Thecontents whereof now follow\\n-\\'From the dark and horrible dungeon of hell\\n Diabolus withall the society of the princes of darkness\\n sends to ourtrusty ones\\n in and about the walls of the town of Mansoul\\nnow impatiently waiting for our most devilish answer to theirvenomous and most poisonous design against the town ofMansoul\\n\\'Our native ones\\n in whom from day to day we boast\\n and inwhose actions all the year long we do greatly delightourselves\\n we received your welcome\\n because highly esteemedletter\\n at the hand of our trusty and greatly beloved\\n theold gentleman\\n Mr\\n Profane\\n  And do give you to understand\\nthat when we had broken it up\\n and had read the contentsthereof\\n to your amazing memory be it spoken\\n our yawninghollow-bellied place\\n where we are\\n made so hideous andyelling a noise for joy\\n that the mountains that stand roundabout Hell-Gate Hill\\n had like to have been shaken to piecesat the sound thereof\\n\\'We could also do no less than admire your faithfulness tous\\n with the greatness of that subtilty that now hath showeditself to be in your heads to serve us against the town ofMansoul\\n  For you have invented for us so excellent a methodfor our proceeding against that rebellious people\\n a moreeffectual cannot be thought of by all the wits of hell\\n  Theproposals\\n therefore\\n which now\\n at last\\n you have sent us\\nsince we saw them\\n we have done little else but highlyapproved and admired them\\n\\'Nay\\n we shall\\n to encourage you in the profundity of yourcraft\\n let you know\\n that\\n at a full assembly and conclave ofour princes and principalities of this place\\n your projectwas discoursed and tossed from one side of our cave to theother by their mightinesses\\n but a better\\n and as was bythemselves judged\\n a more fit and proper way by all theirwits\\n could not be invented\\n to surprise\\n take\\n and make ourown\\n the rebellious town of Mansoul\\n\\'Wherefore\\n in fine\\n all that was said that varied from whatyou had in your letter propounded\\n fell of itself to theground\\n and yours only was stuck to by Diabolus\\n the prince\\nyea\\n his gaping gorge and yawning paunch was on fire to putyour invention into execution\\n\\'We therefore give you to understand that our stout\\n furious\\nand unmerciful Diabolus is raising\\n for your relief\\n and theruin of the rebellious town of Mansoul\\n more than twentythousand doubters to come against that people\\n  They are allstout and sturdy men\\n and men that of old have beenaccustomed to war\\n and that can therefore well endure thedrum\\n  I say\\n he is doing this work of his with all thepossible speed he can\\n for his heart and spirit is engaged init\\n  We desire\\n therefore\\n that\\n as you have hitherto stuckto us\\n and given us both advice and encouragement thus far\\nyou still will prosecute our design\\n nor shall you lose\\n butbe gainers thereby\\n yea\\n we intend to make you the lords ofMansoul\\n\\'One thing may not by any means be omitted\\n that is\\n thosewith us do desire that every one of you that are in Mansoulwould still use all your power\\n cunning\\n and skill\\n withdelusive persuasions\\n yet to draw the town of Mansoul intomore sin and wickedness\\n even that sin may be finished andbring forth death\\n\\'For thus it is concluded with us\\n that the more vile\\nsinful\\n and debauched the town of Mansoul is\\n more backwardwill be their Emmanuel to come to their help\\n either bypresence or other relief\\n yea\\n the more sinful\\n the moreweak\\n and so the more unable will they be to make resistancewhen we shall make our assault upon them to swallow them up\\nYea\\n that may cause that their mighty Shaddai himself maycast them out of his protection\\n yea\\n and send for hiscaptains and soldiers home\\n with his slings and rams\\n andleave them naked and bare\\n and then the town of Mansoul willof itself open to us\\n and fall as the fig into the mouth ofthe eater\\n  Yea\\n to be sure\\n that we then with a great dealof ease shall come upon her and overcome her\\n\\'As to the time of our coming upon Mansoul\\n we\\n as yet\\n havenot fully resolved upon that\\n though at present some of usthink as you\\n that a market-day\\n or a market-day at night\\nwill certainly be the best\\n  However\\n do you be ready\\n andwhen you shall hear our roaring drum without\\n do you be asbusy to make the most horrible confusion within\\n  So shallMansoul certainly be distressed before and

Mr\\n Profane\\n\\'Then Mr\\n Profane addressed himself for his return to Mansoul\\nwith his errand from the horrible pit to the Diaboloniansthat dwelt in that town\\n  So he came up the stairs from thedeep to the mouth of the cave where Cerberus was\\n  Now whenCerberus saw him\\n he asked how did matters go below\\n aboutand against the town of Mansoul\\nPROF\\n  Things go as well as we can expect\\n  The letter that Icarried thither was highly approved\\n and well liked by all mylords\\n and I am returning to tell our Diabolonians so\\n  Ihave an answer to it here in my bosom\\n that I

therewill be glad to hear it\\n and to see you also\\nSo after a few more such kind of compliments\\n Mr\\n Profanetook his leave of his friend Cerberus\\n and Cerberus again\\nwith a thousand of their pit-wishes\\n bid him haste\\n with allspeed\\n to his masters\\n  The which when he had heard\\n he madeobeisance\\n and began to gather up his heels to run\\nThus\\n therefore\\n he returned\\n and went and came to Mansoul\\nand going\\n as afore\\n to the house of Mr\\n Mischief\\n there hefound the Diabolonians assembled\\n and waiting for his return\\nNow when he was come\\n and had presented himself\\n he alsodelivered to them his letter\\n and adjoined this compliment tothem therewith\\n \\'My lords\\n from the confines of the pit\\n thehigh and mighty principalities

Diabolonians and the Mansoulians would walk the streetstogether\\n  Yea\\n they began to seek their peace\\n for theythought that\\n since the sickness had been so mortal inMansoul\\n it was in vain to go to handygripes with them\\nBesides\\n the weakness of Mansoul was the strength of theirenemies\\n and the sins of Mansoul\\n the advantage of theDiabolonians\\n  The foes of Mansoul did also now begin topromise themselves the town for a possession\\n there was nogreat difference now betwixt Mansoulians and Diabolonians\\nboth seemed to be masters of Mansoul\\n  Yea\\n the Diaboloniansincreased and grew\\n but the town of Mansoul diminishedgreatly\\n  There were more than eleven thousand men\\n women\\nand children that died by the sickness in Mansoul\\nBut now\\n as Shaddai would have it\\n there was one whose namewas Mr\\n Prywell\\n a great lover of the people of Mansoul\\n  Andhe\\n as his manner was\\n did go listening up and down inMansoul to see\\n and to hear\\n if at any time he might\\n whetherthere was any design against it or no\\n  For he was always ajealous man\\n and feared some mischief sometime would befalit\\n either from the Diabolonians within\\n or from some powerwithout\\n  Now upon a time it so happened\\n as Mr\\n Prywell wentlistening here and there\\n that he lighted upon a place calledVilehill\\n in Mansoul\\n where Diabolonians used to meet\\n sohearing a muttering\\n (you must know that it was in thenight\\n) he softly drew near to hear\\n nor had he stood longunder the house-end\\n (for there stood a house there\\n) but heheard one confidently affirm\\n that it was not\\n or would notbe long before Diabolus should possess himself again ofMansoul\\n and that then the Diabolonians did intend to put allMansoulians to the sword\\n and would kill and destroy theKing\\'s captains\\n and drive all his soldiers out of the town\\nHe said\\n moreover\\n that he knew there were above twentythousand fighting men prepared by Diabolus for theaccomplishing of this design\\n and that it would not be monthsbefore they all should see it\\nWhen Mr\\n Prywell had heard this story\\n he did quickly believeit was true\\n wherefore he went forthwith to my Lord Mayor\\'shouse\\n and acquainted him therewith\\n who\\n sending for thesubordinate preacher\\n brake the business to him\\n and he assoon gave the alarm to the town\\n for he was now the chiefpreacher in Mansoul\\n because\\n as yet\\n my Lord Secretary wasill at ease\\n  And this was the way that the subordinatepreacher did take to alarm the town therewith\\n  The same hourhe caused the lecture bell to be rung\\n so the people cametogether\\n he gave them then a short exhortation towatchfulness\\n and made Mr\\n Prywell\\'s news the argumentthereof\\n  \\'For\\n\\' said he\\n \\'an horrible plot is contrivedagainst Mansoul\\n even to massacre us all in a day\\n nor isthis story to be slighted\\n for Mr\\n Prywell is the authorthereof\\n  Mr\\n Prywell was always a lover of Mansoul\\n a soberand judicious man\\n a man that is no tattler\\n nor raiser offalse reports\\n but one that loves to look into the verybottom of matters\\n and talks nothing of news\\n but by verysolid arguments\\n\\'I will call him\\n and you shall hear him your own selves\\n\\' sohe called him\\n and he came and told his tale so punctually\\nand affirmed its truth with such ample grounds\\n that Mansoulfell presently under a conviction of the truth of what hesaid\\n  The preacher did also back him\\n saying\\n \\'Sirs\\n it isnot irrational for us to believe it\\n for we have provokedShaddai to anger\\n and have sinned Emmanuel out of the town\\nwe have had too much correspondence with Diabolonians\\n andhave forsaken our former mercies\\n no marvel then\\n if theenemy both within and without should design and plot ourruin\\n and what time like this to do it\\n  The sickness is nowin the town\\n and we have been made weak thereby\\n  Many a goodmeaning man is dead\\n and the Diabolonians of late growstronger and stronger\\n\\'Besides\\n\\' quoth the subordinate preacher\\n \\'I have receivedfrom this good truth-teller this one inkling further\\n that heunderstood by those that he overheard\\n that several lettershave lately passed between the furies and the Diabolonians inorder to our destruction\\n\\'  When Mansoul heard all this\\n andnot being able to gainsay it\\n they lift up their voice andwept\\n  Mr\\n Prywell did also\\n in the presence of the townsmen\\nconfirm all that their subordinate preacher had said\\nWherefore they now set afresh to bewail their folly\\n and to adoubling of petitions to Shaddai and his Son\\n  They alsobrake the business to the captains\\n high commanders\\n and menof war in the town of Mansoul\\n entreating them to use themeans to be strong\\n and to take good courage\\n and that theywould look after their harness\\n and make themselves ready togive Diabolus battle by night and by day\\n shall he come\\n asthey are informed he will\\n to beleaguer the town of Mansoul\\nWhen the captains heard this\\n they being always true loversof the town of Mansoul\\n what do they but like so many Samsonsthey shake themselves\\n and come together to consult andcontrive how to defeat those bold and hellish contrivancesthat were upon the wheel by the means of Diabolus and hisfriends against the now sickly\\n weakly\\n and much impoverishedtown of Mansoul\\n and they agreed upon these followingparticulars\\n-1\\n That the gates of Mansoul should be kept shut\\n and madefast with bars and locks\\n and that all persons that went out\\nor came in\\n should be very strictly examined by the captainsof the guards\\n \\'to the end\\n\\' said they\\n \\'that those that aremanagers of the plot amongst us\\n may\\n either coming or going\\nbe taken\\n and that we may also find out who are the greatcontrivers\\n amongst us\\n of our ruin\\n\\'2\\n The next thing was\\n that a strict search should be madefor all kind of Diabolonians throughout the whole town ofMansoul\\n and that every man\\'s house from top to bottom shouldbe looked into\\n and that\\n too\\n house by house\\n that ifpossible a further discovery might be made of all such amongthem as had a hand in these designs\\n3\\n It was further concluded upon\\n that wheresoever or withwhomsoever any of the Diabolonians were found\\n that eventhose of the town of Mansoul that had given them house andharbour\\n should to their shame\\n and the warning of others\\ntake penance in the open place\\n4\\n It was\\n moreover\\n resolved by the famous town of Mansoul\\nthat a public fast\\n and a day of humiliation\\n should be keptthroughout the whole corporation\\n to the justifying of theirPrince\\n the abasing of themselves before him for theirtransgressions against him\\n and against Shaddai\\n his Father\\nIt was further resolved\\n that all such in Mansoul as did noton that day endeavour to keep that fast\\n and to humblethemselves for their faults\\n but that should mind theirworldly employs\\n or be found wandering up and down thestreets\\n should be taken for Diabolonians\\n and should sufferas Diabolonians for such their wicked doings\\n5\\n It was further concluded then\\n that with what speed\\n andwith what warmth of mind they could\\n they would renew theirhumiliation for sin\\n and their petitions to Shaddai for help\\nthey also resolved\\n to send tidings to the court of all thatMr\\n Prywell had told them\\n6\\n It was also determined\\n that thanks should be given by thetown of Mansoul to Mr\\n Prywell\\n for his diligent seeking ofthe welfare of their town\\n and further\\n that forasmuch as hewas so naturally inclined to seek their good\\n and also toundermine their foes\\n they gave him a commission of scout-master-general\\n for the good of the town of Mansoul\\nWhen the corporation\\n with their captains\\n had thusconcluded\\n they did as they had said\\n they shut up theirgates\\n they made for Diabolonians strict search\\n they madethose with whom any were found to take penance in the openplace\\n they kept their fast\\n and renewed their petitions totheir Prince\\n and Mr\\n Prywell managed his charge and thetrust that Mansoul had put in his hands\\n with greatconscience and good fidelity\\n for he gave himself wholly upto his employ\\n and that not only within the town\\n but he wentout to pry\\n to see\\n and to hear\\nAnd not many days after he provided for his journey\\n and wenttowards Hell-Gate Hill\\n into the country where the Doubterswere\\n where he heard of all that had been talked of inMansoul\\n and he perceived also that Diabolus was almost readyfor his march\\n etc\\n  So he came back with speed\\n and\\n callingthe captains and elders of Mansoul together\\n he told themwhere he had been\\n what he had heard\\n and what he had seen\\nParticularly\\n he told them that Diabolus was almost ready forhis march\\n and that he had made old Mr\\n Incredulity\\n thatonce brake prison in Mansoul\\n the\\n general of his army\\n thathis army consisted all of Doubters\\n and that their number wasabove twenty thousand\\n  He told\\n moreover\\n that Diabolus didintend to bring with him the chief princes of the infernalpit\\n and that he would make them chief captains over hisDoubters\\n  He told them\\n moreover\\n that it was certainly truethat several of the black den would\\n with Diabolus\\n ridereformades to reduce the town of Mansoul to the obedience ofDiabolus\\n their prince\\nHe said\\n moreover\\n that he understood by the Doubters\\n amongwhom he had been\\n that the reason why old Incredulity wasmade general of the whole army\\n was because none truer thanhe to the tyrant\\n and because he had an implacable spiteagainst the welfare of the town of Mansoul\\n  Besides\\n saidhe\\n he remembers the affronts that Mansoul has given him\\n andhe is resolved to be revenged of them\\nBut the black princes shall be made high commanders\\n onlyIncredulity shall be over them all\\n because\\n which I hadalmost forgot\\n he can more easily\\n and more dexterously\\nbeleaguer the town of Mansoul\\n than can any of the princesbesides\\nNow\\n when the captains of Mansoul\\n with the elders of thetown\\n had heard the tidings that Mr\\n Prywell did bring\\n theythought it expedient\\n without further delay\\n to put intoexecution the laws that against the Diabolonians their Princehad made for them\\n and given them in commandment to manageagainst them\\n  Wherefore\\n forthwith a diligent and impartialsearch was made in all houses in Mansoul\\n for all and allmanner of Diabolonians\\n  Now\\n in the house of Mr\\n Mind\\n andin the house of the great Lord Willbewill\\n were twoDiabolonians found\\n  In Mr\\n Mind\\'s house was one LordCovetousness found\\n but he had changed his name to Prudent-Thrifty\\n  In my Lord Willbewill\\'s house\\n one Lasciviousnesswas found\\n but he had changed his name to Harmless-Mirth\\nThese two the captains and elders of the town of Mansoultook\\n and committed them to custody under the hand of Mr\\nTrueman\\n the gaoler\\n and this man handled them so severely\\nand loaded them so well with irons\\n that in time they bothfell into a very deep consumption\\n and died in the prison-house\\n their masters also\\n according to the agreement of thecaptains and elders\\n were brought to take penance in the openplace to their shame\\n and for a warning to the rest of thetown of Mansoul\\nNow\\n this was the manner of penance in those days\\n thepersons offending being made sensible of the evil of theirdoings\\n were enjoined open confession of their faults\\n and astrict amendment of their lives\\nAfter this\\n the captains and elders of Mansoul sought yet tofind out more Diabolonians\\n wherever they lurked\\n whether indens\\n caves\\n holes\\n vaults\\n or where else they could\\n in orabout the wall or town of Mansoul\\n  But though they couldplainly see their footing\\n and so follow them by their trackand smell to their holds\\n even to the mouths of their cavesand dens\\n yet take them\\n hold them\\n and do justice upon them\\nthey could not\\n their ways were so crooked\\n their holds sostrong\\n and they so quick to take sanctuary there\\nBut Mansoul did now with so stiff an hand rule over theDiabolonians that were left\\n that they were glad to shrinkinto corners\\n time was when they durst walk openly\\n and inthe day\\n but now they were forced to embrace privacy and thenight\\n time was when a Mansoulian was their companion\\n butnow they counted them deadly enemies\\n  This good change didMr\\n Prywell\\'s intelligence make in the famous town ofMansoul\\nBy this time\\n Diabolus had finished his army which heintended to bring with him for the ruin of Mansoul\\n and hadset over them captains\\n and other field officers\\n such asliked his furious stomach best\\n himself was lord paramount\\nIncredulity was general of his army\\n their highest captainsshall be named afterwards\\n but now for their officers\\ncolours\\n and scutcheons\\n1\\n Their first captain was Captain Rage\\n he was captain overthe election doubters\\n his were the red colours\\n hisstandard-bearer was Mr\\n Destructive\\n and the great red dragonhe had for his scutcheon\\n2\\n The second captain was Captain Fury\\n he was captain overthe vocation doubters\\n his standard-bearer was Mr\\n Darkness\\nhis colours were those that were pale\\n and he had for hisscutcheon the fiery flying serpent\\n3\\n The third captain was Captain Damnation\\n he was captainover the grace doubters\\n his were the red colours\\n Mr\\n No-Life bare them\\n and he had for his scutcheon the black den\\n4\\n The fourth captain was Captain Insatiable\\n he was captainover the faith doubters\\n his were the red colours\\n Mr\\nDevourer bare them\\n and he had for a scutcheon the yawningjaws\\n5\\n The fifth captain was Captain Brimstone\\n he was captainover the perseverance doubters\\n his also were the redcolours\\n Mr\\n Burning bare them\\n and his scutcheon was theblue and stinking flame\\n6\\n The sixth captain was Captain Torment\\n he was captain overthe resurrection doubters\\n his colours were those that werepale\\n Mr\\n Gnaw was his standard-bearer\\n and he had the blackworm for his scutcheon\\n7\\n The seventh captain was Captain No-Ease\\n he was captainover the salvation doubters\\n his were the red colours\\n Mr\\nRestless bare them\\n and his scutcheon was the ghastly pictureof death\\n8\\n The eighth captain was the Captain Sepulchre\\n he wascaptain over the glory doubters\\n his also were the palecolours\\n Mr\\n Corruption was his standard-bearer\\n and he hadfor his scutcheon a skull\\n and dead men\\'s bones\\n9\\n The ninth captain was Captain Past-Hope\\n he was captain ofthose that are called the felicity doubters\\n his standard-bearer was Mr\\n Despair\\n his also were the red colours\\n andhis scutcheon was a hot iron and the hard heart\\nThese were his captains\\n and these were their forces\\n thesewere their standards\\n these were their colours\\n and thesewere their scutcheons\\n  Now\\n over these did the greatDiabolus make superior captains\\n and they were in numberseven\\n as\\n namely\\n the Lord Beelzebub\\n the Lord Lucifer\\n theLord Legion\\n the Lord Apollyon\\n the Lord Python\\n the LordCerberus\\n and the Lord Belial\\n these seven he set over thecaptains\\n and Incredulity was lord-general\\n and\\n Diabolus wasking\\n  The reformades also\\n such as were like themselves\\nwere made some of them captains of hundreds\\n and some of themcaptains of more\\n  And thus was the army of Incredulitycompleted\\nSo they set out at Hell-Gate Hill\\n for there they had theirrendezvous\\n from whence they came with a straight course upontheir march toward the town of Mansoul\\n  Now\\n as was hintedbefore\\n the town had\\n as Shaddai would have it\\n received fromthe mouth of Mr\\n Prywell the alarm of their coming before\\nWherefore they set a strong watch at the gates\\n and had alsodoubled their guards\\n they also mounted their slings in goodplaces\\n where they might conveniently cast out their greatstones to the annoyance of their furious enemy\\nNor could those Diabolonians that were in the town do thathurt as was designed they should\\n for Mansoul was now awake\\nBut alas\\n poor people\\n they were sorely affrighted at thefirst appearance of their foes\\n and at their sitting downbefore the town\\n especially when they heard the roaring oftheir drum\\n  This\\n to speak truth\\n was amazingly hideous tohear\\n it frighted all men seven miles round\\n if they were butawake and heard it\\n  The streaming of their colours was alsoterrible and dejecting to behold\\nWhen Diabolus was come up against the town\\n first he made hisapproach to Ear-gate\\n and gave it a furious assault\\nsupposing\\n as it seems\\n that his friends in Mansoul had beenready to do the work within\\n but care was taken of thatbefore\\n by the vigilance of the captains\\n  Wherefore\\n missingof the help that he expected from them\\n and finding his armywarmly attended with the stones that the slingers did sling\\n(for that I will say for the captains\\n that considering theweakness that yet was upon them by reason of the longsickness that had annoyed the town of Mansoul\\n they didgallantly behave themselves\\n) he was forced to make someretreat from Mansoul\\n and to entrench himself and his men inthe field without the reach of the slings of the town\\nNow having entrenched himself\\n he did cast up four mountsagainst the town\\n the first he called Mount Diabolus\\n puttinghis own name thereon\\n the more to affright the town ofMansoul\\n the other three he called thus - Mount Alecto\\n MountMegara\\n and Mount Tisiphone\\n for these are the names of thedreadful furies of hell\\n  Thus he began to play his game withMansoul\\n and to serve it as doth the lion his prey\\n even tomake it fall before his terror\\n  But\\n as I said\\n the captainsand soldiers resisted so stoutly\\n and did do such executionwith their stones\\n that they made him\\n though againststomach\\n to retreat\\n wherefore Mansoul began to take courage\\nNow upon Mount Diabolus\\n which was raised on the north sideof the town\\n there did the tyrant set up his standard\\n and afearful thing it was to behold\\n for he had wrought in it bydevilish art\\n after the manner of a scutcheon\\n a flamingflame fearful to behold\\n and the picture of Mansoul burningin it\\nWhen Diabolus had thus done\\n he commanded that his drummershould every night approach the walls of the town of Mansoul\\nand so to beat a parley\\n the command was to do it at nights\\nfor in the daytime they annoyed him with their slings\\n forthe tyrant said\\n that he had a mind to parley with the nowtrembling town of Mansoul\\n and he commanded that the drumsshould beat every night\\n that through weariness they might atlast\\n if possible\\n (at the first they were unwilling yet\\n) beforced to do it\\nSo this drummer did as commanded\\n he arose\\n and did beat hisdrum\\n  But when his drum did go\\n if one looked toward thetown of Mansoul\\n \\'Behold darkness and sorrow\\n and the lightwas darkened in the heaven thereof\\n\\'  No noise was ever heardupon earth more terrible\\n except the voice of Shaddai when hespeaketh\\n  But how did Mansoul tremble\\n it now looked fornothing but forthwith to be swallowed up\\nWhen this drummer had beaten for a parley\\n he made thisspeech to Mansoul\\n \\'My master has bid me tell you\\n that ifyou will willingly submit\\n you shall have the good of theearth\\n but if you shall be stubborn\\n he is resolved to takeyou by force\\n\\'  But by that the fugitive had done beating hisdrum\\n the people of Mansoul had betaken themselves to thecaptains that were in the castle\\n so that there was none toregard\\n nor to give this drummer an answer\\n so he proceededno further that night\\n but returned again to his master tothe camp\\nWhen Diabolus saw that by drumming he could not work outMansoul to his will\\n the next night he sendeth his drummerwithout his drum\\n still to let the townsmen know that he hada mind to parley with them\\n  But when all came to all\\n hisparley was turned into a summons to the town to deliver upthemselves\\n but they gave him neither heed nor hearing\\n forthey remembered what at first it cost them to hear him a fewwords\\nThe next night he sends again\\n and then who should be hismessenger to Mansoul but the terrible Captain Sepulchre\\n soCaptain Sepulchre came up to the walls of Mansoul\\n and madethis oration to the town\\n-\\'O ye inhabitants of the rebellious town of Mansoul\\n  Isummon you in the name of the Prince Diabolus\\n that\\n withoutany more ado\\n you set open the gates of your town\\n and admitthe great lord to come in\\n  But if you shall still rebel\\nwhen we have taken to us the town by force\\n we will swallowyou up as the grave\\n wherefore if you will hearken to mysummons\\n say so\\n and if not then let me know\\n\\'The reason of this my summons\\n\\' quoth he\\n \\'is\\n for that mylord is your undoubted prince and lord\\n as you yourselveshave formerly owned\\n  Nor shall that assault that was givento my lord\\n when Emmanuel dealt so dishonourably by him\\nprevail with him to lose his right\\n and to forbear to attemptto recover his own\\n  Consider\\n then\\n O Mansoul\\n with thyself\\nwilt thou show thyself peaceable\\n or no\\n  If thou shaltquietly yield up thyself\\n then our old friendship shall berenewed\\n but if thou shalt yet refuse and rebel\\n then expectnothing but fire and sword\\n\\'When the languishing town of Mansoul had heard this summonerand his summons\\n they were yet more put to their dumps\\n butmade to the captain no answer at all\\n so away he went as hecame\\nBut\\n after some consultation among themselves\\n as also withsome of their captains\\n they applied themselves afresh to theLord Secretary for counsel and advice from him\\n for this LordSecretary was their chief preacher\\n (as also is mentionedsome pages before\\n) only now he was ill at ease\\n and of himthey begged favour in these two or three things -1\\n That he would look comfortably upon them\\n and not keephimself so much retired from them as formerly\\n  Also\\n that hewould be prevailed with to give them a hearing\\n while theyshould make known their miserable condition to him\\n  But tothis he told them as before\\n that \\'as yet he was but ill atease\\n and therefore could not do as he had formerly done\\n\\'2\\n The second thing that they desired was\\n that he would bepleased to give them his advice about their now so importantaffairs\\n for that Diabolus was come and set down before thetown with no less than twenty thousand doubters\\n  They said\\nmoreover\\n that both he and his captains were cruel men\\n andthat they were afraid of them\\n  But to this he said\\n \\'Youmust look to the law of the Prince\\n and there see what islaid upon you to do\\n\\'3\\n Then they desired that his highness would help them toframe a petition to Shaddai\\n and unto Emmanuel his Son\\n andthat he would set his own hand thereto as a token that he wasone with them in it\\n \\'For\\n\\' said they\\n \\'my Lord\\n many a onehave we sent\\n but can get no answer of peace\\n but now\\nsurely\\n one with thy hand unto it may obtain good forMansoul\\n\\'But all the answer that he gave to this was\\n \\'that they hadoffended their Emmanuel\\n and had also grieved himself\\n andthat therefore they must as yet partake of their owndevices\\n\\'This answer of the Lord Secretary fell like a millstone uponthem\\n yea\\n it crushed them so that they could not tell whatto do\\n yet they durst not comply with the demands ofDiabolus\\n nor with the demands of his captain\\n  So then herewere the straits that the town of Mansoul was betwixt\\n whenthe enemy came upon her\\n her foes were ready to swallow herup\\n and her friends did forbear to help her\\nThen stood up my Lord Mayor\\n whose name was my LordUnderstanding\\n and he began to pick and pick\\n until he hadpicked comfort out of that seemingly bitter saying of theLord Secretary\\n for thus he descanted upon it\\n \\'First\\n\\' saidhe\\n \\'this unavoidably follows upon the saying of my Lord\\n\"that we must yet suffer for our sins\\n\"  Secondly\\n But\\n\\'quoth he\\n \\'the words yet sound as if at last we should besaved from our enemies\\n and that after a few more sorrows\\nEmmanuel will come and be our help\\n\\'  Now the Lord Mayor wasthe more critical in his dealing with the Secretary\\'s words\\nbecause my lord was more than a prophet\\n and because none ofhis words were such\\n but that at all times they were mostexactly significant\\n and the townsmen were allowed to pryinto them\\n and to expound them to their best advantage\\nSo they took their leaves of my lord\\n and returned\\n and went\\nand came to the captains\\n to whom they did tell what my LordHigh Secretary had said\\n who\\n when they had heard it\\n wereall of the same opinion as was my Lord Mayor himself\\n  Thecaptains\\n therefore\\n began to take some courage unto them\\nand to prepare to make some brave attempt upon the camp ofthe enemy\\n and to destroy all that were Diabolonians\\n withthe roving doubters that the tyrant had brought with him todestroy the poor town of Mansoul\\nSo all betook themselves forthwith to their places - theCaptains to theirs\\n the Lord Mayor to his\\n the subordinatepreacher to his\\n and my Lord Willbewill to his\\n  The captainslonged to be at some work for their prince\\n for theydelighted in warlike achievements\\n  The next day\\n therefore\\nthey came together and consulted\\n and after consultation had\\nthey resolved to give an answer to the captain of Diaboluswith slings\\n and so they did at the rising of the sun on themorrow\\n for Diabolus had adventured to come nearer again\\n butthe sling-stones were to him and his like hornets\\n  For asthere is nothing to the town of Mansoul so terrible as theroaring of Diabolus\\'s drum\\n so there is nothing to Diabolusso terrible as the well playing of Emmanuel\\'s slings\\nWherefore Diabolus was forced to make another retreat\\n yetfurther off from the famous town of Mansoul\\n  Then did theLord Mayor of Mansoul cause the bells to be rung\\n \\'and thatthanks should be sent to the Lord High Secretary by the mouthof the subordinate preacher\\n for that by his words thecaptains and elders of Mansoul had been strengthened againstDiabolus\\n\\'When Diabolus saw that his captains and soldiers\\n high lordsand renowned\\n were frightened\\n and beaten down by the stonesthat came from the golden slings of the Prince of the town ofMansoul\\n he bethought himself\\n and said\\n \\'I will try to catchthem by fawning\\n I will try to flatter them into my net\\n\\'Wherefore\\n after a while\\n he came down again to the wall\\n notnow with his drum\\n nor with Captain Sepulchre\\n but having allbesugared his lips\\n he seemed to be a very sweet-mouthed\\npeaceable prince\\n designing nothing for humour\\'s sake\\n nor tobe revenged on Mansoul for injuries by them done to him\\n butthe welfare\\n and good\\n and advantage of the town and peopletherein was now\\n as he said\\n his only design\\n  Wherefore\\nafter he had called for audience\\n and desired that thetownsfolk would give it to him\\n he proceeded in his oration\\nand said\\n-\\'Oh\\n the desire of my heart\\n the famous town of Mansoul\\n howmany nights have I watched\\n and how many weary steps have Itaken\\n if perhaps I might do thee good\\n  Far be it\\n far be itfrom me to desire to make a war upon you\\n if ye will butwillingly and quietly deliver up yourselves unto

then\\n shall Mansoul think to escape my hand and force\\n\\'Diabolus having thus handed his flattering\\n fawning\\ndeceitful\\n and lying speech to the famous town of Mansoul\\nthe Lord Mayor replied to him as follows\\n \\'O Diabolus\\n princeof darkness\\n and master of all deceit\\n thy lying flatterieswe have had and made sufficient probation of\\n and have tastedtoo deeply of that destructive cup already\\n  Should wetherefore again hearken unto thee\\n and so break thecommandments of our great Shaddai\\n to join in affinity withthee\\n would not our Prince reject us\\n and

ready todie by thy hand\\n than to fall in with thy flattering andlying deceits\\n\\'When the tyrant saw that there was little to be got byparleying with my Lord Mayor\\n he fell into an hellish rage\\nand resolved that again\\n with his army of doubters\\n he wouldanother time assault the town of Mansoul\\nSo he called for his drummer\\n who beat up for his men (andwhile he did beat\\n Mansoul did shake) to be in a readiness togive battle to the corporation\\n then Diabolus drew near withhis army\\n and thus disposed of his men\\n  Captain Cruel andCaptain Torment\\n these he drew up and placed against Feel-gate\\n and commanded them to sit down there for the war\\n  Andhe also appointed that\\n if need were\\n Captain No-Ease shouldcome in to their relief\\n  At Nose-gate he placed the CaptainBrimstone and Captain Sepulchre\\n and bid them look well totheir ward\\n on that side of the town of Mansoul\\n  But at Eye-gate he placed that grim-faced one\\n the Captain Past-Hope\\nand there also now he did set up his terrible standard\\nNow Captain Insatiable\\n he was to look to the carriages ofDiabolus\\n and was also appointed to take into custody that\\nor those persons and things\\n that should at any time as preybe taken from the enemy\\nNow Mouth-gate the inhabitants of Mansoul kept for a sally-port\\n wherefore that they kept strong\\n for that it was it byand out at which the townsfolk did send their petitions toEmmanuel their Prince\\n  That also was the gate from the topof which the captains did play their slings at the enemies\\nfor that gate stood somewhat ascending\\n so that the placingof them there\\n and the letting of them fly from that place\\ndid much execution against the tyrant\\'s army\\n  Wherefore\\n forthese causes\\n with others\\n Diabolus sought\\n if possible\\n toland up Mouth-gate with dirt\\nNow\\n as Diabolus was busy and industrious in preparing tomake his assault upon the town of Mansoul\\n without\\n so thecaptains and soldiers in the corporation were as busy inpreparing within\\n they mounted their slings\\n they set uptheir banners\\n they sounded their trumpets\\n and putthemselves in such order as was judged most for the annoyanceof the enemy\\n and for the advantage of Mansoul\\n and gave totheir soldiers orders to be ready at the sound of the trumpetfor war\\n  The Lord Willbewill also\\n he took the charge ofwatching against the rebels within\\n and to do what he couldto take them while without\\n or to stifle them within theircaves\\n dens\\n and holes in the town-wall of Mansoul\\n  And\\n tospeak the truth of him\\n ever since he took penance for hisfault\\n he has showed as much honesty and bravery of spirit asany he in Mansoul\\n for he took one Jolly\\n and his brotherGriggish\\n the two sons of his servant Harmless-Mirth\\n (for tothat day\\n though the father was committed to ward\\n the sonshad a dwelling in the house of my lord\\n) - I say\\n he tookthem\\n and with his own hands put them to the cross\\n  And thiswas the reason why he hanged them up\\n after their father wasput into the hands of Mr\\n True-Man the gaoler\\n they\\n hissons\\n began to play his pranks\\n and to be ticking and toyingwith the daughters of their lord\\n nay\\n it was jealoused thatthey were too familiar with them\\n the which was brought tohis lordship\\'s ear\\n  Now his lordship being unwillingunadvisedly to put any man to death\\n did not suddenly fallupon them\\n but set watch and spies to see if the thing wastrue\\n of the which he was soon informed\\n for his twoservants\\n whose names were Find-Out and Tell-All\\n catchedthem together in uncivil manner more than once or twice\\n andwent and told their lord\\n  So when my Lord Willbewill hadsufficient ground to believe the thing was true\\n he takes thetwo young Diabolonians\\n (for such they were\\n for their fatherwas a Diabolonian born\\n) and has them to Eye-gate\\n where heraised a very high cross\\n just in the face of Diabolus\\n andof his army\\n and there he hanged the young villains\\n indefiance to Captain Past-Hope\\n and of the horrible standardof the tyrant\\nNow this Christian act of the brave Lord Willbewill didgreatly abash Captain Past-Hope\\n discouraged the army ofDiabolus\\n put fear into the Diabolonian runagates in Mansoul\\nand put strength and courage into the captains that belongedto Emmanuel\\n the Prince\\n for they without did gather\\n andthat by this very act of my Lord\\n that Mansoul was resolvedto fight\\n and that the Diabolonians within the town could notdo such things as Diabolus had hopes they would\\n  Nor wasthis the only proof of the brave Lord Willbewill\\'s honesty tothe town\\n nor of his loyalty to his Prince\\n as willafterwards appear\\nNow\\n when the children of Prudent-Thrifty\\n who dwelt with Mr\\nMind\\n (for Thrift left children with Mr\\n Mind\\n when he wasalso committed to prison\\n and their names were Gripe andRake-All\\n these he begat of Mr\\n Mind\\'s bastard daughter\\nwhose name was Mrs\\n Hold-fast-Bad\\n) - I say\\n when hischildren perceived how the Lord Willbewill had served themthat dwelt with him\\n what do they but\\n lest they should drinkof the same cup\\n endeavour to make their escape\\n  But Mr\\nMind\\n being wary of it\\n took them and put them in hold in hishouse till morning\\n (for this was done over night\\n) andremembering that by the law of Mansoul all Diabolonians wereto die\\n (and to be sure they were at least by father\\'s sidesuch\\n and some say by mother\\'s side too\\n) what does he buttakes them and puts them in chains\\n and carries them to theselfsame place where my lord hanged his two before\\n and therehe hanged them\\nThe townsmen also took great encouragement at this act of Mr\\nMind\\n and did what they could to have taken some more ofthese Diabolonian troublers of Mansoul\\n but at that time therest lay so squat and close\\n that they could not beapprehended\\n so they set against them a diligent watch\\n andwent every man to his place\\nI told you a little before\\n that Diabolus and his army weresomewhat abashed and discouraged at the sight of what my LordWillbewill did\\n when he hanged up those two youngDiabolonians\\n but his discouragement quickly turned itselfinto furious madness and rage against the town of Mansoul\\nand fight it he would\\n  Also the townsmen and captainswithin\\n they had their hopes and their expectationsheightened\\n believing at last the day would be theirs\\n sothey feared them the less\\n  Their subordinate preacher\\n too\\nmade a sermon about it\\n and he took that theme for his text\\n\\'Gad\\n a troop shall overcome him\\n but he shall overcome atthe last\\n\\'  Whence he showed\\n that though Mansoul should besorely put to it at the first\\n yet the victory should mostcertainly be Mansoul\\'s at the last\\nSo Diabolus commanded that his drummer should beat a chargeagainst the town\\n and the captains also that were in the townsounded a charge against them\\n but they had no drum\\n theywere trumpets of silver with which they sounded against them\\nThen they which were of the camp of Diabolus came down to thetown to take it\\n and the captains in the castle\\n with theslingers at Mouth-gate\\n played upon them amain\\n  And nowthere was nothing heard in the camp of Diabolus but horriblerage and blasphemy\\n but in the town good words\\n prayer\\n andsinging of psalms\\n  The enemy replied with horribleobjections\\n and the terribleness of their drum\\n but the townmade answer with the slapping of their slings\\n and themelodious noise of their trumpets\\n  And thus the fight lastedfor several days together\\n only now and then they had somesmall intermission\\n in the which the townsmen refreshedthemselves\\n and the captains made ready for another assault\\nThe captains of Emmanuel were clad in silver armour\\n and thesoldiers in that which was of proof\\n the soldiers of Diaboluswere clad in iron which was made to give place to Emmanuel\\'sengine-shot\\n  In the town\\n some were hurt\\n and some weregreatly wounded\\n  Now\\n the worst of it was\\n a chirurgeon wasscarce in Mansoul\\n for that Emmanuel at present was absent\\nHowbeit\\n with the leaves of a tree the wounded were kept fromdying\\n yet their wounds did greatly putrefy\\n and some didgrievously stink\\n  Of the townsmen\\n these were wounded\\nnamely\\n my Lord Reason\\n he was wounded in the head\\n  Anotherthat was wounded was the brave Lord Mayor\\n he was wounded inthe eye\\n  Another that was wounded was Mr\\n Mind\\n he receivedhis wound about the stomach\\n  The honest subordinate preacheralso\\n he received a shot not far off the heart but none ofthese were mortal\\nMany also of the inferior sort were not only wounded butslain outright\\nNow\\n in the camp of Diabolus were wounded and slain aconsiderable number\\n for instance\\n Captain Rage\\n he waswounded\\n and so was Captain Cruel\\n  Captain Damnation wasmade to retreat\\n and to intrench himself further off ofMansoul\\n  The standard also of Diabolus was beaten down\\n andhis standard-bearer\\n Captain Much-Hurt\\n had his brains beatout with a sling-stone\\n to the no little grief and shame ofhis prince Diabolus\\nMany also of the doubters were slain outright\\n though enoughof them were left alive to make Mansoul shake and totter\\nNow the victory that day being turned to Mansoul\\n did putgreat valour into the townsmen and captains\\n and did coverDiabolus\\'s camp with a cloud\\n but withal it made them farmore furious\\n  So the next day Mansoul rested\\n and commandedthat the bells should be rung\\n the trumpets also joyfullysounded\\n and the captains shouted round the town\\nMy Lord Willbewill also was not idle\\n but did notable servicewithin against the domestics\\n or the Diabolonians that werein the town\\n not only by keeping them in awe\\n for he lightedon one at last whose name was Mr\\n Anything\\n a fellow of whommention was made before\\n for it was he\\n if you remember\\n thatbrought the three fellows to Diabolus\\n whom the Diabolonianstook out of Captain Boanerges\\'s companies\\n and that persuadedthem to list themselves under the tyrant\\n to fight againstthe army of Shaddai\\n  My Lord Willbewill did also take anotable Diabolonian\\n whose name was Loose-Foot\\n this Loose-Foot was a scout to the vagabonds in Mansoul\\n and that diduse to carry tidings out of Mansoul to the camp\\n and out ofthe camp to those of the enemies in Mansoul\\n  Both these mylord sent away safe to Mr\\n True-Man\\n the gaoler\\n with acommandment to keep them in irons\\n for he intended then tohave them out to be crucified\\n when it would be for the bestto the corporation\\n and most for the discouragement of thecamp of the enemies\\nMy Lord Mayor also\\n though he could not stir about so much asformerly\\n because of the wound that he lately received\\n yetgave he out orders to all that were the natives of Mansoul\\nto look to their watch\\n and stand upon their guard\\n and\\n asoccasion should offer\\n to prove themselves men\\nMr\\n Conscience\\n the preacher\\n he also did his utmost to keepall his good documents alive upon the hearts of the people ofMansoul\\nWell\\n awhile after\\n the captains and stout ones of the townof Mansoul agreed and resolved upon a time to make a sallyout upon the camp of Diabolus\\n and this must be done in thenight\\n and there was the folly of Mansoul\\n (for the night isalways the best for the enemy\\n but the worst for Mansoul tofight in\\n) but yet they would do it\\n their courage was sohigh\\n their last victory also still stuck in their memories\\nSo the night appointed being come\\n the Prince\\'s bravecaptains cast lots who should lead the van in this new anddesperate expedition against Diabolus\\n and against hisDiabolonian army\\n and the lot fell to Captain Credence\\n toCaptain Experience\\n and to Captain Good-Hope\\n to lead theforlorn hope\\n  (This Captain Experience the Prince createdsuch when himself did reside in the town of Mansoul\\n)  So\\n asI said\\n they made their sally out upon the army that lay inthe siege against them\\n and their hap was to fall in with themain body of their enemies\\n  Now Diabolus and his men beingexpertly accustomed to night-work\\n took the alarm presently\\nand were as ready to give them battle\\n as if they had sentthem word of their coming\\n  Wherefore to it they went amain\\nand blows were hard on every side\\n the hell drum also wasbeat most furiously\\n while the trumpets of the Prince mostsweetly sounded\\n  And thus the battle was joined\\n and CaptainInsatiable looked to the enemy\\'s carriages\\n and waited whenhe should receive some prey\\nThe Prince\\'s captains fought it stoutly\\n beyond what indeedcould be expected they should\\n they wounded many\\n they madethe whole army of Diabolus to make a retreat\\n  But I cannottell how\\n but the brave Captain Credence\\n Captain Good-Hope\\nand Captain Experience\\n as they were upon the pursuit\\ncutting down\\n and following hard after the enemy in the rear\\nCaptain Credence stumbled and fell\\n by which fall he caughtso great a hurt\\n that he could not rise till CaptainExperience did help him up\\n at which their men were put indisorder\\n  The captain also was so full of pain\\n that hecould not forbear but aloud to cry out\\n at this\\n the othertwo captains fainted\\n supposing that Captain Credence hadreceived his mortal wound\\n their men also were moredisordered\\n and had no list to fight\\n  Now Diabolus beingvery observing\\n though at this time as yet he was put to theworst\\n perceiving that a halt was made among the men thatwere the pursuers\\n what does he but\\n taking it for grantedthat the captains were either wounded or dead\\n he thereforemakes at first a stand\\n then faces about\\n and so comes upupon the Prince\\'s army with as much of his fury as hell couldhelp him to\\n and his hap was to fall in just among the threecaptains\\n Captain Credence\\n Captain Good-Hope\\n and CaptainExperience\\n and did cut\\n wound\\n and pierce them sodreadfully\\n that what through discouragement\\n what throughdisorder\\n and what through the wounds that they had received\\nand also the loss of much blood\\n they scarce were able\\nthough they had for their power the three best hands inMansoul\\n to get safe into the hold again\\nNow\\n when the body of the Prince\\'s army saw how these threecaptains were put to the worst\\n they thought it their wisdomto make as safe and good a retreat as they could\\n and soreturned by the sally-port again\\n and so there was an end ofthis present action\\n  But Diabolus was so flushed with thisnight\\'s work\\n that he promised himself\\n in few days\\n an easyand complete conquest over the town of Mansoul\\n wherefore\\n onthe day following\\n he comes up to the sides thereof withgreat boldness\\n and demands entrance\\n and that forthwith theydeliver themselves up to his government\\n  The Diabolonians\\ntoo\\n that were within\\n they began to be somewhat brisk\\n as weshall show afterward\\nBut the valiant Lord Mayor replied\\n that what he got he mustget by force\\n for as long as Emmanuel\\n their Prince\\n wasalive\\n (though he at present was not so with them as theywished\\n) they should never consent to yield Mansoul up toanother\\nAnd with that the Lord Willbewill stood up\\n and said\\n\\'Diabolus\\n thou master of the den\\n and enemy to all that isgood\\n we poor inhabitants of the town of Mansoul are too wellacquainted with thy rule and government\\n and with the end ofthose things that for certain will follow submitting to thee\\nto do it\\n  Wherefore though while we were without knowledgewe suffered thee to take us\\n (as the bird that saw not thesnare fell into the hands of the fowler\\n) yet since we havebeen turned from darkness to light\\n we have also been turnedfrom the power of Satan to God\\n  And though through thysubtlety\\n and also the subtlety of the Diabolonians within\\nwe have sustained much loss\\n and also plunged ourselves intomuch perplexity\\n yet give up ourselves\\n lay down our arms\\nand yield to so horrid a tyrant as thou\\n we shall not\\n dieupon the place we choose rather to do\\n  Besides\\n we havehopes that in time deliverance will come from court unto us\\nand therefore we yet will maintain a war against thee\\n\\'This brave speech of the Lord Willbewill\\n with that also ofthe Lord Mayor\\n did somewhat abate the boldness of Diabolus\\nthough it kindled the fury of his rage\\n  It also succouredthe townsmen and captains\\n yea\\n it was as a plaster to thebrave Captain Credence\\'s wound\\n for you must know that abrave speech now (when the captains of the town with theirmen of war came home routed\\n and when the enemy took courageand boldness at the success that he had obtained to draw upto the walls\\n and demand entrance\\n as he did) was in season\\nand also advantageous\\nThe Lord Willbewill also did play the man within\\n for whilethe captains and soldiers were in the field\\n he was in armsin the town\\n and wherever by him there was a Diabolonianfound\\n they were forced to feel the weight of his heavy hand\\nand also the edge of his penetrating sword\\n many therefore ofthe Diabolonians he wounded\\n as the Lord Cavil\\n the LordBrisk\\n the Lord Pragmatic\\n and the Lord Murmur\\n several alsoof the meaner sort he did sorely maim\\n though there cannot atthis time an account be given you of any that he slewoutright\\n  The cause\\n or rather the advantage that my LordWillbewill had at this time to do thus\\n was for that thecaptains were gone out to fight the enemy in the field\\n  \\'Fornow\\n\\' thought the Diabolonians within\\n \\'is our time to stirand make an uproar in the town\\n\\'  What do they therefore butquickly get themselves into a body\\n and fall forthwith tohurricaning in Mansoul\\n as if now nothing but whirlwind andtempest should be there\\n  Wherefore\\n as I said\\n he takes thisopportunity to fall in among them with his men\\n cutting andslashing with courage that was undaunted\\n at which theDiabolonians with all haste dispersed themselves to theirholds\\n and my lord to his place as before\\nThis brave act of my lord did somewhat revenge the wrong doneby Diabolus to the captains\\n and also did let them know thatMansoul was not to be parted with for the loss of a victoryor two\\n wherefore the wing of the tyrant was clipped again\\nas to boasting\\n - I mean in comparison of what he would havedone\\n if the Diabolonians had put the town to the same plightto which he had put the captains\\nWell\\n Diabolus yet resolves to have the other bout withMansoul\\n  \\'For\\n\\' thought he\\n \\'since I beat them once\\n I maybeat them twice\\n\\'  Wherefore he commanded his men to be readyat such an hour of the night\\n to make a fresh assault uponthe town\\n and he gave it out in special that they should bendall their force against Feel-gate\\n and attempt to break intothe town through that\\n  The word that then he did give to hisofficers and soldiers was Hell-fire\\n  \\'And\\n\\' said he\\n \\'if webreak in upon them\\n as I wish we do\\n either with some\\n orwith all our force\\n let them that break in look to it\\n thatthey forget not the word\\n  And let nothing be heard in thetown of Mansoul but\\n \"Hell-fire\\n  Hell-fire\\n Hell-fire\\n\"\\'The drummer was also to beat without ceasing\\n and thestandard-bearers were to display their colours\\n the soldiers\\ntoo\\n were to put on what courage they could\\n and to see thatthey played manfully their parts against the town\\nSo when night was come\\n and all things by the tyrant madeready for the work\\n he suddenly makes his assault upon Feel-gate\\n and after he had awhile struggled there\\n he throws thegate wide open\\n for the truth is\\n those gates were but weak\\nand so most easily made to yield\\n  When Diabolus had thus farmade his attempt\\n he placed his captains (namely\\n Torment andNo-Ease) there\\n so he attempted to press forward\\n but thePrince\\'s captains came down upon him\\n and made his entrancemore difficult than he desired\\n  And\\n to speak truth\\n theymade what resistance they could\\n but the three of their bestand most valiant captains being wounded\\n and by their woundsmade much incapable of doing the town that service theywould\\n (and all the rest having more than their hands full ofthe doubters\\n and their captains that did follow Diabolus\\n)they were overpowered with force\\n nor could they keep themout of the town\\n  Wherefore the Prince\\'s men and theircaptains betook themselves to the castle\\n as to thestronghold of the town\\n and this they did partly for theirown security\\n partly for the security of the town\\n andpartly\\n or rather chiefly\\n to preserve to Emmanuel theprerogative-royal of Mansoul\\n for so was the castle ofMansoul\\nThe captains therefore being fled into the castle\\n the enemy\\nwithout much resistance\\n possess themselves of the rest ofthe town\\n and spreading themselves as they went into everycorner\\n they cried out as they marched\\n according to thecommand of the tyrant\\n \\'Hell-fire\\n Hell-fire\\n Hell-fire\\n\\' sothat nothing for a while throughout the town of Mansoul couldbe heard but the direful noise of \\'Hell-fire\\n\\' together withthe roaring of Diabolus\\'s drum\\n  And now did the clouds hangblack over Mansoul\\n nor to reason did anything but ruin seemto attend it\\n  Diabolus also quartered his soldiers in thehouses of the inhabitants of the town of Mansoul\\n  Yea\\n thesubordinate preacher\\'s house was as full of these outlandishdoubters as ever it could hold\\n and so was my Lord Mayor\\'s\\nand my Lord Willbewill\\'s also\\n  Yea\\n where was there acorner\\n a cottage\\n a barn\\n or a hogstye\\n that now was notfull of these vermin\\n  Yea\\n they turned the men of the townout of their houses\\n and would lie in their beds\\n and sit attheir tables themselves\\n  Ah\\n poor Mansoul\\n now thou feelestthe fruits of sin\\n yea\\n what venom was in the flatteringwords of Mr\\n Carnal-Security\\n  They made great havoc ofwhatever they laid their hands on\\n yea\\n they fired the townin several places\\n many young children also were by themdashed in pieces\\n and those that were yet unborn theydestroyed in their mothers\\' wombs\\n for you must needs thinkthat it could not now be otherwise\\n for what conscience\\n whatpity\\n what bowels of compassion can any expect at the handsof outlandish doubters\\n  Many in Mansoul that were women\\nboth young and old\\n they forced\\n ravished\\n and beastlikeabused\\n so that they swooned\\n miscarried\\n and many of themdied\\n and so lay at the top of every street\\n and in all by-places of the town\\nAnd now did Mansoul seem to be nothing but a den of dragons\\nan emblem of hell\\n and a place of total darkness\\n  Now didMansoul lie almost like the barren wilderness\\n nothing butnettles\\n briars\\n thorns\\n weeds\\n and stinking things seemednow to cover the face of Mansoul\\n  I told you before\\n howthat these Diabolonian doubters turned the men of Mansoul outof their beds\\n and now I will add\\n they wounded them\\n theymauled them\\n yea\\n and almost brained many of them\\n  Many didI say\\n yea most\\n if not all of them\\n  Mr\\n Conscience they sowounded\\n yea\\n and his wounds so festered\\n that he could haveno ease day nor night\\n but lay as if continually upon a rack\\nbut that Shaddai rules all\\n certainly they had slain himoutright\\n  Mr\\n Lord Mayor they so abused that they almost putout his eyes\\n and had not my Lord Willbewill got into thecastle\\n they intended to have chopped him all to pieces\\n forthey did look upon him\\n as his heart now stood\\n to be one ofthe very worst that was in Mansoul against Diabolus and hiscrew\\n  And indeed he hath shown himself a man\\n and more ofhis exploits you will hear of afterwards\\nNow\\n a man might have walked for days together in Mansoul\\nand scarcely have seen one in the town that looked like areligious man\\n  Oh\\n the fearful state of Mansoul now\\n nowevery corner swarmed with outlandish doubters\\n red-coats andblack-coats walked the town by clusters\\n and filled up allthe houses with hideous noises\\n vain songs\\n lying stories\\nand blasphemous language against Shaddai and his Son\\n  Nowalso those Diabolonians that lurked in the walls and dens andholes that were in the town of Mansoul\\n came forth and showedthemselves\\n yea\\n walked with open face in company with thedoubters that were in Mansoul\\n  Yea\\n they had more boldnessnow to walk the streets\\n to haunt the houses\\n and to showthemselves abroad\\n than had any of the honest inhabitants ofthe now woful town of Mansoul\\nBut Diabolus and his outlandish men were not at peace inMansoul\\n for they were not there entertained as were thecaptains and forces of Emmanuel\\n the townsmen did browbeatthem what they could\\n nor did they partake or make stroy ofany of the necessaries of Mansoul\\n but that which they seizedon against the townsmen\\'s will\\n what they could\\n they hidfrom them\\n and what they could not\\n they had with an ill-will\\n  They\\n poor hearts\\n had rather have had their room thantheir company\\n but they were at present their captives\\n andtheir captives for the present they were forced to be\\n  But\\nI say\\n they discountenanced them as much as they were able\\nand showed them all the dislike that they could\\nThe captains also from the castle did hold them in continualplay with their slings\\n to the chafing and fretting of theminds of the enemies\\n  True\\n Diabolus made a great manyattempts to have broken open the gates of the castle\\n but Mr\\nGodly-Fear was made the keeper of that\\n and he was a man ofthat courage\\n conduct\\n and valour\\n that it was in vain\\n aslong as life lasted within him\\n to think to do that work\\nthough mostly desired\\n wherefore all the attempts thatDiabolus made against him were fruitless\\n  I have wishedsometimes that that man had had the whole rule of the town ofMansoul\\nWell\\n this was the condition of the town of Mansoul for abouttwo years and a half\\n the body of the town was the seat ofwar\\n the people of the town were driven into holes\\n and theglory of Mansoul was laid in the dust\\n  What rest\\n then\\ncould be to the inhabitants\\n what peace could Mansoul have\\nand what sun could shine upon it\\n  Had the enemy lain so longwithout in the plain against the town\\n it had been enough tohave famished them\\n but now\\n when they shall be within\\n whenthe town shall be their tent\\n their trench and fort againstthe castle that was in the town\\n when the town shall beagainst the town\\n and shall serve to be a defence to theenemies of her strength and life\\n I say\\n when they shall makeuse of the forts and town-holds to secure themselves in\\n eventill they shall take\\n spoil\\n and demolish the castle\\n - thiswas terrible\\n and yet this was now the state of the town ofMansoul\\nAfter the town of Mansoul had been in this sad and lamentablecondition\\n for so long a time as I have told you\\n and nopetitions that they presented their Prince with\\n all thiswhile\\n could prevail\\n the inhabitants of the town\\n namely\\nthe elders and chief of Mansoul\\n gathered together\\n and\\nafter some time spent in condoling their miserable state andthis miserable judgment coming upon them\\n they agreedtogether to draw up yet another petition\\n and to send it awayto Emmanuel for relief\\n  But Mr\\n Godly-Fear stood up andanswered\\n that he knew that his Lord the Prince never did norever would receive a petition for these matters\\n from thehand of any whoever\\n unless the Lord Secretary\\'s hand was toit\\n \\'and this\\n\\' quoth he\\n \\'is the reason that you prevailednot all this while\\n\\'  Then they said they would draw up one\\nand get the Lord Secretary\\'s hand unto it\\n  But Mr\\n Godly-Fear answered again\\n that he knew also that the LordSecretary would not set his hand to any petition that himselfhad not an hand in composing and drawing up\\n  \\'And besides\\n\\'said he\\n \\'the Prince doth know my Lord Secretary\\'s hand fromall the hands in the world\\n wherefore he cannot be deceivedby any pretence whatever\\n  Wherefore my advice is that you goto my Lord\\n and implore him to lend you his aid\\n\\'  (Now hedid yet abide in the castle\\n where all the captains and men-at-arms were\\n)So they heartily thanked Mr\\n Godly-Fear\\n took his counsel\\nand did as he had bidden them\\n  So they went and came to myLord\\n and made known the cause of their coming to him\\nnamely\\n that since Mansoul was in so deplorable a condition\\nhis Highness would be pleased to undertake to draw up apetition for them to Emmanuel\\n the Son of the mighty Shaddai\\nand to their King and his Father by him\\nThen said the Secretary to them\\n \\'What petition is it thatyou would have me draw up for you\\n\\'  But they said\\n \\'Our Lordknows best the state and condition of the town of Mansoul\\nand how we are backslidden and degenerated from the Prince\\nthou also knowest who is come up to war against us\\n and howMansoul is now the seat of war\\n  My Lord knows\\n moreover\\nwhat barbarous usages our men\\n women\\n and children havesuffered at their hands\\n and how our homebred Diabolonians dowalk now with more boldness than dare the townsmen in thestreets of Mansoul\\n  Let our Lord therefore\\n according to thewisdom of God that is in him\\n draw up a petition for his poorservants to our Prince Emmanuel\\n\\'  \\'Well\\n\\' said the LordSecretary\\n \\'I will draw up a petition for you\\n and will alsoset my hand thereto\\n\\'  Then said they\\n \\'But when shall wecall for it at the hands of our Lord\\n\\'  But he answered\\n\\'Yourselves must be present at the doing of it\\n yea\\n you mustput your desires to it\\n  True\\n the hand and pen shall bemine\\n but the ink and paper must be yours\\n else how can yousay it is your petition\\n  Nor have I need to petition formyself\\n because I have not offended\\n\\' He also added asfolloweth\\n \\'No petition goes from me in my name to thePrince\\n and so to his Father by him\\n but when the people thatare chiefly concerned therein do join in heart and soul inthe matter\\n for that must be inserted therein\\n\\'So they did heartily agree with the sentence of the Lord\\n anda petition was forthwith drawn up for them\\n  But now\\n whoshould carry it\\n that was next\\n  But the Secretary advisedthat Captain Credence should carry it\\n for he was a well-spoken man\\n  They therefore called for him\\n and propounded tohim the business\\n  \\'Well\\n\\' said the captain\\n \\'I gladly acceptof the motion\\n and though I am lame\\n I will do this businessfor you with as much speed\\n and as well as I can\\n\\'The contents of the petition were to this purpose\\'O our Lord\\n and Sovereign Prince Emmanuel\\n the potent\\n thelong-suffering Prince\\n grace is poured into thy lips\\n and tothee belong mercy and forgiveness\\n though we have rebelledagainst thee\\n  We\\n who are no more worthy to be called thyMansoul\\n nor yet fit to partake of common benefits\\n dobeseech thee\\n and thy Father by thee\\n to do away ourtransgressions\\n  We confess that thou mightest cast us awayfor them\\n but do it not for thy name\\'s sake\\n let the Lordrather take an opportunity\\n at our miserable condition\\n tolet out his bowels and compassions to us\\n  We are compassedon every side\\n Lord\\n our own backslidings reprove us\\n ourDiabolonians within our town fright us\\n and the army of theangel of the bottomless pit distresses us\\n  Thy grace can beour salvation\\n and whither to go but to thee we know not\\n\\'Furthermore\\n O gracious Prince\\n we have weakened ourcaptains\\n and they are discouraged\\n sick\\n and\\n of late\\n someof them grievously worsted and beaten out of the field by thepower and force of the tyrant\\n  Yea\\n even those of ourcaptains\\n in whose valour we did formerly use to put most ofour confidence\\n they are as wounded men\\n  Besides\\n Lord\\n ourenemies are lively\\n and they are strong\\n they vaunt and boastthemselves\\n and do threaten to part us among themselves for abooty\\n  They are fallen also upon us\\n Lord\\n with manythousand doubters\\n such as with whom we cannot tell what todo\\n they are all grim-looked and unmerciful ones\\n and theybid defiance to us and thee\\n\\'Our wisdom is gone\\n our power is gone\\n because thou artdeparted from us\\n nor have we what we may call ours but sin\\nshame\\n and confusion of face for sin\\n  Take pity upon us\\n OLord\\n take pity upon us\\n thy miserable town of Mansoul\\n andsave us out of the hands of our enemies\\n  Amen\\n\\'This petition\\n as was touched afore\\n was handed by the LordSecretary\\n and carried to the court by the brave and moststout Captain Credence\\n  Now he carried it out at Mouth-gate\\n(for that\\n as I said\\n was the sally-port of the town\\n) and hewent and came to Emmanuel with it\\n  Now how it came out\\n I donot know\\n but for certain it did\\n and that so far as to reachthe ears of Diabolus\\n  Thus I conclude\\n because that thetyrant had it presently by the end\\n and charged the town ofMansoul with it\\n saying\\n \\'Thou rebellious and stubborn-hearted Mansoul\\n I will make thee to leave off petitioning\\nArt thou yet for petitioning\\n  I will make thee to leave\\n\\'Yea\\n he also knew who the messenger was that carried thepetition to the Prince\\n and it made him both to fear andrage\\nWherefore he commanded that his drum should be beat again\\n athing that Mansoul could not abide to hear\\n but when Diaboluswill have his drum beat\\n Mansoul must abide the noise\\n  Well\\nthe drum was beat\\n and the Diabolonians were gatheredtogether\\nThen said Diabolus\\n \\'O ye stout Diabolonians\\n be it knownunto you\\n that there is treachery hatched against us in therebellious town of Mansoul\\n for albeit the town is in ourpossession\\n as you see\\n yet these miserable Mansoulians haveattempted to dare\\n and have been so hardy as yet to send tothe court to Emmanuel for help\\n  This I give you tounderstand\\n that ye may yet know how to carry it to thewretched town of Mansoul\\n  Wherefore\\n O my trustyDiabolonians\\n I command that yet more and more ye distressthis town of Mansoul\\n and vex it with your wiles\\n ravishtheir women\\n deflower their virgins\\n slay their children\\nbrain their ancients\\n fire their town\\n and what othermischief you can\\n and let this be the reward of theMansoulians from me\\n for their desperate rebellions againstme\\n\\'This\\n you see\\n was the charge\\n but something stepped inbetwixt that and execution\\n for as yet there was but littlemore done than to rage\\nMoreover\\n when Diabolus had done thus\\n he went the next wayup to the castle gates\\n and demanded that\\n upon pain ofdeath\\n the gates should be opened to him\\n and that entranceshould be given him and his men that followed after\\n  To whomMr\\n Godly-Fear replied\\n (for he it was that had the charge ofthat gate\\n) that the gate should not be opened unto him\\n norto the men that followed after him\\n  He said\\n moreover\\n thatMansoul\\n when she had suffered awhile\\n should be madeperfect\\n strengthened\\n settled\\nThen said Diabolus\\n \\'Deliver me\\n then\\n the men that havepetitioned against me\\n especially Captain Credence\\n thatcarried it to your Prince\\n deliver that varlet into my hands\\nand I will depart from the town\\n\\'Then up starts a Diabolonian\\n whose name was Mr\\n Fooling\\n andsaid\\n \\'My lord offereth you fair\\n it is better for you thatone man perish\\n than that your whole Mansoul should beundone\\n\\'But Mr\\n Godly-Fear made him this replication\\n \\'How long willMansoul be kept out of the dungeon\\n when she hath given upher faith to Diabolus\\n  As good lose the town\\n as loseCaptain Credence\\n for if one be gone the other must follow\\n\\'But to that Mr\\n Fooling said nothing\\nThen did my Lord Mayor reply\\n and said\\n \\'O thou devouringtyrant\\n be it known unto thee\\n we shall hearken to none ofthy words\\n we are resolved to resist thee as long as acaptain\\n a man\\n a sling\\n and a stone to throw at thee shallbe found in the town of Mansoul\\n\\'  But Diabolus answered\\n \\'Doyou hope\\n do you wait\\n do you look for help and deliverance\\nYou have sent to Emmanuel\\n but your wickedness sticks tooclose in your skirts\\n to let innocent prayers come out ofyour lips\\n  Think you that you shall be prevailers andprosper in this design\\n  You will fail in your wish\\n you willfail in your attempts\\n for it is not only I\\n but yourEmmanuel is against you\\n yea\\n it is he that hath sent meagainst you to subdue you\\n  For what\\n then\\n do you hope\\n orby what means will you escape\\n\\'Then said the Lord Mayor\\n \\'We have sinned indeed\\n but thatshall be no help to thee\\n for our Emmanuel hath said it\\n andthat in great faithfulness\\n \"and him that cometh to me I willin no wise cast out\\n\"  He hath also told us\\n O our enemy\\nthat \"all manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven\" tothe sons of men\\n  Therefore we dare not despair\\n but willlook for\\n wait for\\n and hope for deliverance still\\n\\'Now\\n by this time\\n Captain Credence was returned and comefrom the court from Emmanuel to the castle of Mansoul\\n and hereturned to them with a packet\\n  So my Lord Mayor\\n hearingthat Captain Credence was come\\n withdrew himself from thenoise of the roaring of the tyrant\\n and left him to yell atthe wall of the town\\n or against the gates of the castle\\n  Sohe came up to the captain\\'s lodgings\\n and saluting him\\n heasked him of his welfare\\n and what was the best news atcourt\\n  But when he asked Captain Credence that\\n the waterstood in his eyes\\n  Then said the captain\\n \\'Cheer up\\n mylord\\n for all will be well in time\\n\\'  And with that he firstproduced his packet\\n and laid it by\\n but that the Lord Mayor\\nand the rest of the captains\\n took for sign of good tidings\\nNow a season of grace being come\\n he sent for all thecaptains and elders of the town\\n that were here and there intheir lodgings in the castle and upon their guard\\n to letthem know that Captain Credence was returned from the court\\nand that he had something in general\\n and something inspecial\\n to communicate to them\\n  So they all came up to him\\nand saluted him\\n and asked him concerning his journey\\n andwhat was the best news at the court\\n  And he answered them ashe had done the Lord Mayor before\\n that all would be well atlast\\n  Now\\n when the captain had thus saluted them\\n he openedhis packet\\n and thence did draw out his several notes forthose that he had sent for\\nAnd the first note was for my Lord Mayor\\n wherein wassignified\\n- That the Prince Emmanuel had taken it well thatmy Lord Mayor had been so true and trusty in his office\\n andthe great concerns that lay upon him for the town and peopleof Mansoul\\n  Also\\n he bid him to know\\n that he took it wellthat he had been so bold for his Prince Emmanuel\\n and hadengaged so faithfully in his cause against Diabolus\\n  He alsosignified\\n at the close of his letter\\n that he should shortlyreceive his reward\\nThe second note that came out\\n was for the noble LordWillbewill\\n wherein there was signified\\n- That his PrinceEmmanuel did well understand how valiant and courageous hehad been for the honour of his Lord\\n now in his absence\\n andwhen his name was under contempt by Diabolus\\n  There wassignified also\\n that his Prince had taken it well that he hadbeen so faithful to the town of Mansoul\\n in his keeping of sostrict a hand and eye over and so strict a rein upon the neckof the Diabolonians\\n that did still lie lurking in theirseveral holes in the famous town of Mansoul\\n  He signified\\nmoreover\\n how that he understood that my Lord had\\n with hisown hand\\n done great execution upon some of the chief of therebels there\\n to the great discouragement of the adverseparty and to the good example of the whole town of Mansoul\\nand that shortly his lordship should have his reward\\nThe third note came out for the subordinate preacher\\n whereinwas signified\\n- That his Prince took it well from him\\n thathe had so honestly and so faithfully performed his office\\nand executed the trust committed to him by his Lord\\n while heexhorted\\n rebuked\\n and forewarned Mansoul according to thelaws of the town\\n  He signified\\n moreover\\n that he took itwell at his hand that he called to fasting\\n to sackcloth\\n andashes\\n when Mansoul was under her revolt\\n  Also\\n that hecalled for the aid of the Captain Boanerges to help in soweighty a work\\n and that shortly he also should receive hisreward\\nThe fourth note came out for Mr\\n Godly-Fear\\n wherein his Lordthus signified\\n- That his Lordship observed\\n that he was thefirst of all the men in Mansoul that detected Mr\\n Carnal-Security as the only one that\\n through his subtlety andcunning\\n had obtained for Diabolus a defection and decay ofgoodness in the blessed town of Mansoul\\n  Moreover\\n his Lordgave him to understand\\n that he still remembered his tearsand mourning for the state of Mansoul\\n  It was also observed\\nby the same note\\n that his Lord took notice of his detectingof this Mr\\n Carnal-Security\\n at his own table among hisguests\\n in his own house\\n and that in the midst of hisjolliness\\n even while he was seeking to perfect his villaniesagainst the town of Mansoul\\n  Emmanuel also took notice thatthis reverend person\\n Mr\\n Godly-Fear\\n stood stoutly to it\\n atthe gates of the castle\\n against all the threats and attemptsof the tyrant\\n and that he had put the townsmen in a way tomake their petition to their Prince\\n so as that he mightaccept thereof\\n and as they might obtain an answer of peace\\nand that therefore shortly he should receive his reward\\nAfter all this\\n there was yet produced a note which waswritten to the whole town of Mansoul\\n whereby they perceived- That their Lord took notice of their so often repeating ofpetitions to him\\n and that they should see more of the fruitsof such their doings in time to come\\n  Their Prince did alsotherein tell them\\n that he took it well\\n that their heart andmind\\n now at last\\n abode fixed upon him and his ways\\n thoughDiabolus had made such inroads upon them\\n and that neitherflatteries on the one hand\\n nor hardships on the other\\n couldmake them yield to serve his cruel designs\\n  There was alsoinserted at the bottom of this note - That his Lordship hadleft the town of Mansoul in the hands of the Lord Secretary\\nand under the conduct of Captain Credence\\n saying\\n \\'Bewarethat you yet yield yourselves unto their governance\\n and indue time you shall receive your reward\\n\\'So\\n after the brave Captain Credence had delivered his notesto those to whom they belonged\\n he retired himself to my LordSecretary\\'s lodgings\\n and there spends time in conversingwith him\\n for they too were very great one with another\\n anddid indeed know more how things would go with Mansoul thandid all the townsmen besides\\n  The Lord Secretary also lovedthe Captain Credence dearly\\n yea\\n many a good bit was senthim from my Lord\\'s table\\n also\\n he might have a show ofcountenance\\n when the rest of Mansoul lay under the clouds\\nso\\n after some time for converse was spent\\n the captainbetook himself to his chambers to rest\\n  But it was not longafter when my Lord did send for the captain again\\n so thecaptain came to him\\n and they greeted one another with usualsalutations\\n  Then said the captain to the Lord Secretary\\n\\'What hath my Lord to say to his servant\\n\\'  So the LordSecretary took him and had him aside\\n and after a sign or twoof more favour\\n he said\\n \\'I have made thee the Lord\\'slieutenant over all the forces in Mansoul\\n so that\\n from thisday forward\\n all men in Mansoul shall be at thy word\\n andthou shalt be he that shall lead in\\n and that shall lead outMansoul\\n  Thou shalt therefore manage\\n according to thyplace\\n the war for thy Prince\\n and for the town of Mansoul\\nagainst the force and power of Diabolus\\n and at thy commandshall the rest of the captains be\\n\\'Now the townsmen began to perceive what interest the captainhad\\n both with the court\\n and also with the Lord Secretary inMansoul\\n for no man before could speed when sent\\n nor bringsuch good news from Emmanuel as he\\n  Wherefore what do they\\nafter some lamentation that they made no more use of him intheir distresses\\n but send by their subordinate preacher tothe Lord Secretary\\n to desire him that all that ever theywere and had might be put under the government\\n care\\ncustody\\n and conduct of Captain Credence\\nSo their preacher went and did his errand\\n and received thisanswer from the mouth of his Lord\\n that Captain Credenceshould be the great doer in all the King\\'s army\\n against theKing\\'s enemies\\n and also for the welfare of Mansoul\\n  So hebowed to the ground\\n and thanked his Lordship\\n and returnedand told his news to the townsfolk\\n  But all this was donewith all imaginable secrecy\\n because the foes had yet greatstrength in the town\\n  But to return to our story again\\nWhen Diabolus saw himself thus boldly confronted by the LordMayor\\n and perceived the stoutness of Mr\\n Godly-Fear\\n he fellinto a rage\\n and forthwith called a council of war\\n that hemight be revenged on Mansoul\\n  So all the princes of the pitcame together\\n and old Incredulity at the head of them\\n withall the captains of his army\\n  So they consult what to do\\nNow the effect and conclusion of the council that day was howthey might take the castle\\n because they could not concludethemselves masters of the town so long as that was in thepossession of their enemies\\nSo one advised this way\\n and another advised that\\n but whenthey could not agree in their verdict\\n Apollyon\\n thatpresident of the council\\n stood up\\n and thus he began\\n \\'Mybrotherhood\\n\\' quoth he\\n \\'I have two things to propound untoyou\\n and my first is this\\n  Let us withdraw ourselves fromthe town into the plain again\\n for our presence here will dous no good\\n because the castle is yet in our enemies\\' hands\\nnor is it possible that we should take that\\n so long as somany brave captains are in it\\n and that this bold fellow\\nGodly-Fear\\n is made the keeper of the gates of it\\n  Now\\n whenwe have withdrawn ourselves into the plain\\n they\\n of theirown accord\\n will be glad of some little ease\\n and it may be\\nof their own accord\\n they again may begin to be remiss\\n andeven their so being will give them a bigger blow than we canpossibly give them ourselves\\n  But if that should fail\\n ourgoing forth of the town may draw the captains out after us\\nand you know what it cost them when we fought them in thefield before\\n  Besides\\n can we but draw them out into thefield\\n we may lay an ambush behind the town\\n which shall\\nwhen they are come forth abroad\\n rush in and take possessionof the castle\\n\\'But Beelzebub stood up\\n and replied\\n saying\\n \\'It isimpossible to draw them all off from the castle\\n some\\n youmay be sure\\n will lie there to keep that\\n wherefore it willbe but in vain thus to attempt\\n unless we were sure that theywill all come out\\n\\'  He therefore concluded that what wasdone must be done by some other means\\n  And the most likelymeans that the greatest of their heads could invent\\n was thatwhich Apollyon had advised to before\\n namely\\n to get thetownsmen again to sin\\n  \\'For\\n\\' said he\\n \\'it is not our beingin the town\\n nor in the field\\n nor our fighting\\n nor ourkilling of their men\\n that can make us the masters ofMansoul\\n for so long as one in the town is able to lift uphis finger against us\\n Emmanuel will take their parts\\n and ifhe shall take their parts\\n we know what time of day it willbe with us\\n  Wherefore\\n for my part\\n\\' quoth he\\n \\'there is\\n inmy judgment\\n no way to bring them into bondage to us\\n likeinventing a way to make them sin\\n  Had we\\n\\' said he\\n \\'leftall our doubters at home\\n we had done as well as we have donenow\\n unless we could have made them the masters and governorsof the castle\\n for doubters at a distance are but likeobjections refelled with arguments\\n  Indeed\\n can we but getthem into the hold\\n and make them possessors of that\\n the daywill be our own\\n  Let us\\n therefore\\n withdraw ourselves intothe plain\\n (not expecting that the captains in Mansoul shouldfollow us\\n) but yet\\n I say\\n let us do this\\n and before we sodo\\n let us advise again with our trusty Diabolonians that areyet in their holds of Mansoul\\n and set them to work to betraythe town to us\\n for they indeed must do it\\n or it will beleft undone for ever\\n\\'  By these sayings of Beelzebub\\n (for Ithink it was he that gave this counsel\\n) the whole conclavewas forced to be of his opinion\\n namely\\n that the way to getthe castle was to get the town to sin\\n  Then they fell toinventing by what means they might do this thing\\nThen Lucifer stood up\\n and said\\n \\'The counsel of Beelzebub ispertinent\\n  Now\\n the way to bring this to pass\\n in mineopinion\\n is this\\n let us withdraw our force from the town ofMansoul\\n let us do this\\n and let us terrify them no more\\neither with summons\\n or threats\\n or with the noise of ourdrum\\n or any other awakening means\\n  Only let us lie in thefield at a distance\\n and be as if we regarded them not\\n forfrights\\n I see\\n do but awaken them\\n and make them more standto their arms\\n  I have also another stratagem in my head\\n youknow Mansoul is a market-town\\n and a town that delights incommerce\\n what\\n therefore\\n if some of our Diabolonians shallfeign themselves far-country men\\n and shall go out and bringto the market of Mansoul some of our wares to sell\\n and whatmatter at what rates they sell their wares\\n though it be butfor half the worth\\n  Now\\n let those that thus shall trade intheir market be those that are witty and true to us\\n and Iwill lay my crown to pawn it will do\\n  There are two that arecome to my thoughts already\\n that I think will be arch atthis work\\n and they are Mr\\n Penny-wise-pound-foolish\\n and Mr\\nGet-i\\'the-hundred-and-lose-i\\'the-shire\\n nor is this man withthe long name at all inferior to the other\\n  What\\n also\\n ifyou join with them Mr\\n Sweet-world and Mr\\n Present-good\\n theyare men that are civil and cunning\\n but our true friends andhelpers\\n  Let these\\n with as many more\\n engage in thisbusiness for us\\n and let Mansoul be taken up in muchbusiness\\n and let them grow full and rich\\n and this is theway to get ground of them\\n  Remember ye not that thus weprevailed upon Laodicea\\n and how many at present do we holdin this snare\\n  Now\\n when they begin to grow full\\n they willforget their misery\\n and if we shall not affright them\\n theymay happen to fall asleep\\n and so be got to neglect theirtown watch\\n their castle watch\\n as well as their watch at thegates\\n\\'Yea\\n may we not\\n by this means\\n so cumber Mansoul withabundance\\n that they shall be forced to make of their castlea warehouse\\n instead of a garrison fortified against us\\n anda receptacle for men of war\\n  Thus\\n if we get our goods andcommodities thither\\n I reckon that the castle is more thanhalf ours\\n  Besides\\n could we so order it that it shall befilled with such kind of wares\\n then if we made a suddenassault upon them\\n it would be hard for the captains to takeshelter there\\n  Do you not know that of the parable\\n \"Thedeceitfulness of riches choke the word\"\\n and again\\n \"When theheart is over-charged with surfeiting and drunkenness\\n andthe cares of this life\\n\" all mischief comes upon them atunawares\\n\\'Furthermore\\n my lords\\n\\' quoth he\\n \\'you very well know thatit is not easy for a people to be filled with our things\\n andnot to have some of our Diabolonians as retainers to theirhouses and services\\n  Where is a Mansoulian that is full ofthis world\\n that has not for his servants and waiting-men\\nMr\\n Profuse\\n or Mr\\n Prodigality\\n or some other of ourDiabolonian gang\\n as Mr\\n Voluptuous\\n Mr\\n Pragmatical\\n Mr\\nOstentation\\n or the like\\n  Now these can take the castle ofMansoul\\n or blow it up\\n or make it unfit for a garrison forEmmanuel\\n and any of these will do\\n  Yea\\n these\\n for aught Iknow\\n may do it for us sooner than an army of twenty thousandmen\\n  Wherefore\\n to end as I began\\n my advice is\\n that wequietly withdraw ourselves\\n not offering any further force\\nor forcible attempts\\n upon the castle\\n at least at this time\\nand let us set on foot our new project\\n and let us see ifthat will not make them destroy themselves\\n\\'This advice was highly applauded by them all\\n and wasaccounted the very masterpiece of hell\\n namely\\n to chokeMansoul with a fulness of this world\\n and to surfeit herheart with the good things thereof\\n  But see how things meettogether\\n  Just as this Diabolonian council was broken up\\nCaptain Credence received a letter from Emmanuel\\n thecontents of which were these\\n That upon the third day hewould meet him in the field in the plains about Mansoul\\n\\'Meet me in the field\\n\\' quoth the Captain\\n \\'what meaneth mylord by this\\n  I know not what he meaneth by meeting me inthe field\\n\\'  So he took the note in his hand\\n and did carryit to my Lord Secretary\\n to ask his thoughts thereupon\\n formy Lord was a seer in all matters concerning the King\\n andalso for the good and comfort of the town of Mansoul\\n  So heshowed my Lord the note\\n and desired his opinion thereof\\n\\'For my part\\n\\' quoth Captain Credence\\n \\'I know not themeaning thereof\\n\\'  So my lord did take and read it and\\n aftera little pause\\n he said\\n \\'The Diabolonians have had againstMansoul a great consultation to-day\\n they have\\n I say\\n thisday been contriving the utter ruin of the town\\n and theresult of their council is\\n to set Mansoul into such a waywhich\\n if taken\\n will surely make her destroy herself\\n  And\\nto this end\\n they are making ready for their own departureout of the town\\n intending to betake themselves to the fieldagain\\n\\' and there to lie till they shall see whether thistheir project will take or no\\n  But be thou ready with themen of thy Lord\\n (for on the third day they will be in theplain\\n) there to fall upon the Diabolonians\\n for the Princewill by that time be in the field\\n yea\\n by that it is breakof day\\n sun-rising\\n or before\\n and that with a mighty forceagainst them\\n  So he shall be before them\\n and thou shalt bebehind them\\n and betwixt you both their army shall bedestroyed\\n\\'When Captain Credence heard this\\n away goes he to the rest ofthe captains\\n and tells them what a note he had a while sincereceived from the hand of Emmanuel\\n  \\'And\\n\\' said he\\n \\'thatwhich was dark therein hath my lord the Lord Secretaryexpounded unto me\\n\\'  He told them\\n moreover\\n what by himselfand by them must be done to answer the mind of their Lord\\nThen were the captains glad\\n and Captain Credence commandedthat all the King\\'s trumpeters should ascend to thebattlements of the castle\\n and there\\n in the audience ofDiabolus and of the whole town of Mansoul\\n make the bestmusic that heart could invent\\n  The trumpeters then did asthey were commanded\\n  They got themselves up to the top ofthe castle\\n and thus they began to sound\\n  Then did Diabolusstart\\n and said\\n \\'What can be the meaning of this\\n theyneither sound Boot-and-saddle\\n nor Horse-and-away\\n nor acharge\\n  What do these madmen mean that yet they should be somerry and glad\\n\\'  Then answered one of themselves and said\\n\\'This is for joy that their Prince Emmanuel is coming torelieve the town of Mansoul\\n and to this end he is at thehead of an army\\n and that this relief is near\\n\\'The men of Mansoul also were greatly concerned at thismelodious charm of the trumpets\\n they said\\n yea\\n theyanswered one another\\n saying\\n \\'This can be no harm to us\\nsurely this can be no harm to us\\n\\'  Then said theDiabolonians\\n \\'What had we best to do\\n\\' and it was answered\\n\\'It was best to quit the town\\n\\' and \\'that\\n\\' said one\\n \\'ye maydo in pursuance of your last counsel\\n and by so doing also bebetter able to give the enemy battle\\n should an army fromwithout come upon us\\n  So\\n on the second day\\n they withdrewthemselves from Mansoul\\n and abode in the plains without\\n butthey encamped themselves before Eye-gate\\n in what terrene andterrible manner they could\\n  The reason why they would notabide in the town (besides the reasons that were debated intheir late conclave) was\\n for that they were not possessed ofthe stronghold\\n and \\'because\\n\\' said they\\n \\'we shall have moreconvenience to fight\\n and also to fly\\n if need be\\n when weare encamped in the open plains\\n\\'  Besides\\n the town wouldhave been a pit for them rather than a place of defence\\n hadthe Prince come up and inclosed them fast therein\\n  Thereforethey betook themselves to the field\\n that they might also beout of the reach of the slings\\n by which they were muchannoyed all the while that they were in the town\\nWell\\n the time that the captains were to fall upon theDiabolonians being come\\n they eagerly prepared themselves foraction\\n for Captain Credence had told the captains overnight\\n that they should meet their Prince in the field to-morrow\\n  This\\n therefore\\n made them yet far more desirous tobe engaging the enemy\\n for \\'You shall see the Prince in thefield to-morrow\\' was like oil to a flaming fire\\n for of along time they had been at a distance\\n they therefore werefor this the more earnest and desirous of the work\\n  So\\n as Isaid\\n the hour being come\\n Captain Credence\\n with the rest ofthe men of war\\n drew out their forces before it was day bythe sally-port of the town\\n  And\\n being all ready\\n CaptainCredence went up to the head of the army\\n and gave to therest of the captains the word\\n and so they to their under-officers and soldiers\\n the word was \\'The sword of the PrinceEmmanuel\\n and the shield of Captain Credence\\n\\' which is\\n inthe Mansoulian tongue\\n \\'The word of God and faith\\n\\'  Then thecaptains fell on\\n and began roundly to front\\n and flank\\n andrear Diabolus\\'s camp\\nNow\\n they left Captain Experience in the town\\n because he wasyet ill of his wounds\\n which the Diabolonians had given himin the last fight\\n  But when he perceived that the captainswere at it\\n what does he but\\n calling for his crutches withhaste\\n gets up\\n and away he goes to the battle\\n saying\\n\\'Shall I lie here\\n when my brethren are in the fight\\n andwhen Emmanuel\\n the Prince\\n will show himself in the field tohis servants\\n\\'  But when the enemy saw the man come with hiscrutches\\n they were daunted yet the more\\n \\'for\\n\\' thoughtthey\\n \\'what spirit has possessed these Mansoulians\\n that theyfight us upon their crutches\\n\\'  Well\\n the captains\\n as Isaid\\n fell on\\n and did bravely handle their weapons\\n stillcrying out and shouting\\n as they laid on blows\\n \\'The sword ofthe Prince Emmanuel\\n and the shield of Captain Credence\\n\\'Now\\n when Diabolus saw that the captains were come out\\n andthat so valiantly they surrounded his men\\n he concluded that\\nfor the present\\n nothing from them was to be looked for butblows\\n and the dints of their \\'two-edged sword\\n\\'Wherefore he also falls on upon the Prince\\'s army with allhis deadly force\\n so the battle was joined\\n  Now who was itthat at first Diabolus met with in the fight\\n but CaptainCredence on the one hand\\n and the Lord Willbewill on theother\\n now Willbewill\\'s blows were like the blows of a giant\\nfor that man had a strong arm\\n and he fell in upon theelection doubters\\n for they were the life-guard of Diabolus\\nand he kept them in play a good while\\n cutting and batteringshrewdly\\n  Now when Captain Credence saw my lord engaged\\n hedid stoutly fall on\\n on the other hand\\n upon the same companyalso\\n so they put them to great disorder\\n  Now Captain Good-Hope had engaged the vocation doubters\\n and they were sturdymen\\n but the captain was a valiant man\\n Captain Experiencedid also send him some aid\\n so he made the vocation doubtersto retreat\\n  The rest of the armies were hotly engaged\\n andthat on every side\\n and the Diabolonians did fight stoutly\\nThen did my Lord Secretary command that the slings from thecastle should be played\\n and his men could throw stones at anhair\\'s breadth\\n  But\\n after a while\\n those that were made tofly before the captains of the Prince\\n did begin to rallyagain\\n and they came up stoutly upon the rear of the Prince\\'sarmy\\n wherefore the Prince\\'s army began to faint\\n but\\nremembering that they should see the face of their Prince by-and-by\\n they took courage\\n and a very fierce battle wasfought\\n  Then shouted the captains\\n saying\\n \\'The sword of thePrince Emmanuel\\n and the shield of Captain Credence\\n\\' andwith that Diabolus gave back\\n thinking that more aid had beencome\\n  But no Emmanuel as yet appeared\\n  Moreover\\n the battledid hang in doubt\\n and they made a little retreat on bothsides\\n  Now\\n in the time of respite\\n Captain Credence bravelyencouraged his men to stand to it\\n and Diabolus did the like\\nas well as he could\\n  But Captain Credence made a bravespeech to his soldiers\\n the contents whereof here follow\\n-\\'Gentlemen soldiers\\n and my brethren in this design\\n itrejoiceth me much to see in the field for our Prince\\n thisday\\n so stout and so valiant an army\\n and such faithfullovers of Mansoul\\n  You have hitherto\\n as hath become you\\nshown yourselves men of truth and courage against theDiabolonian forces\\n so that\\n for all their boast\\n they havenot yet much cause to boast of their gettings\\n  Now take toyourselves your wonted courage\\n and show yourselves men eventhis once only\\n for in a few minutes after the nextengagement\\n this time\\n you shall see your Prince show himselfin the field\\n for we must make this second assault upon thistyrant Diabolus\\n and then Emmanuel comes\\n\\'No sooner had the captain made this speech to his soldiers\\nbut one Mr\\n Speedy came post to the captain from the Prince\\nto tell him that Emmanuel was at hand\\n  This news when thecaptain had received\\n he communicated to the other field-officers\\n and they again to their soldiers and men of war\\nWherefore\\n like men raised from the dead\\n so the captains andtheir men arose\\n made up to the enemy\\n and cried as before\\n\\'The sword of the Prince Emmanuel\\n and the shield of CaptainCredence\\n\\'The Diabolonians also bestirred themselves\\n and maderesistance as well as they could\\n but in this last engagementthe Diabolonians lost their courage\\n and many of the doubtersfell down dead to the ground\\n  Now\\n when they had been inheat of battle about an hour or more\\n Captain Credence liftup his eyes and saw\\n and\\n behold\\n Emmanuel came\\n and he camewith colours flying\\n trumpets sounding\\n and the feet of hismen scarce touched the ground\\n they hasted with that celeritytowards the captains that were engaged\\n  Then did Credencewind with his men to the townward\\n and gave to Diabolus thefield\\n so Emmanuel came upon him on the one side\\n and theenemies\\' place was betwixt them both\\n  Then again they fellto it afresh\\n and now it was but a little while more butEmmanuel and Captain Credence met\\n still trampling down theslain as they came\\nBut when the captains saw that the Prince was come\\n and thathe fell upon the Diabolonians on the other side\\n and thatCaptain Credence and his Highness had got them up betwixtthem\\n they shouted\\n (they so shouted that the ground rentagain\\n) saying\\n \\'The sword of Emmanuel\\n and the shield ofCaptain Credence\\n\\'  Now\\n when Diabolus saw that he and hisforces were so hard beset by the Prince and his princelyarmy\\n what does he\\n and the lords of the pit that were withhim\\n but make their escape\\n and forsake their army\\n and leavethem to fall by the hand of Emmanuel\\n and of his nobleCaptain Credence\\n so they fell all down slain before them\\nbefore the Prince\\n and before his royal army\\n there was notleft so much as one doubter alive\\n they lay spread upon theground dead men\\n as one would spread dung upon the land\\nWhen the battle was over\\n all things came into order in thecamp\\n  Then the captains and elders of Mansoul came togetherto salute Emmanuel\\n while without the corporation\\n so theysaluted him\\n and welcomed him\\n and that with a thousandwelcomes\\n for that he was come to the borders of Mansoulagain\\n  So he smiled upon them\\n and said\\n \\'Peace be to you\\n\\'Then they addressed themselves to go to the town\\n they wentthen to go up to Mansoul\\n they\\n the Prince\\n with all the newforces that now he had brought with him to the war\\n  Also allthe gates of the town were set open for his reception\\n soglad were they of his blessed return\\n  And this was themanner and order of this going of his into Mansoul\\nFirst\\n  As I said\\n all the gates of the town were set open\\nyea\\n the gates of the castle also\\n the elders\\n too\\n of thetown of Mansoul placed themselves at the gates of the town\\nto salute him at his entrance thither\\n and so they did\\n for\\nas he drew near\\n and approached towards the gates\\n they said\\n\\'Lift up your heads\\n O ye gates\\n and be ye lift up\\n yeeverlasting doors\\n and the King of glory shall come in\\n\\'  Andthey answered again\\n \\'Who is the King of glory\\n\\' and theymade return to themselves\\n \\'The Lord\\n strong and mighty\\n theLord mighty in battle\\n  Lift up your heads\\n O ye gates\\n evenlift them up\\n ye everlasting doors\\n\\' etc\\nSecondly\\n  It was ordered also\\n by those of Mansoul\\n that allthe way from the town gates to those of the castle\\n hisblessed Majesty should be entertained with the song\\n by themthat had the best skill in music in all the town of Mansoul\\nthen did the elders\\n and the rest of the men of Mansoul\\nanswer one another as Emmanuel entered the town\\n till he cameat the castle gates\\n with songs and sound of trumpets\\nsaying\\n \\'They have seen thy goings\\n O God\\n even the goings ofmy God\\n my King\\n in the sanctuary\\n  So the singers wentbefore\\n the players on instruments followed after\\n and amongthem were the damsels playing on timbrels\\n\\'Thirdly\\n  Then the captains\\n (for I would speak a word ofthem\\n) they in their order waited on the Prince\\n as heentered into the gates of Mansoul\\n  Captain Credence wentbefore\\n and Captain Good-Hope with him\\n Captain Charity camebehind with other of his companions\\n and Captain Patiencefollowed after all\\n and the rest of the captains\\n some on theright hand\\n and some on the left\\n accompanied Emmanuel intoMansoul\\n  And all the while the colours were displayed\\n thetrumpets sounded\\n and continual shoutings were among thesoldiers\\n  The Prince himself rode into the town in hisarmour\\n which was all of beaten gold\\n and in his chariot -the pillars of it were of silver\\n the bottom thereof of gold\\nthe covering of it was of purple\\n the midst thereof beingpaved with love for the daughters of the town of Mansoul\\nFourthly\\n  When the Prince was come to the entrance ofMansoul\\n he found all the streets strewed with lilies andflowers\\n curiously decked with boughs and branches from thegreen trees that stood round about the town\\n  Every door alsowas filled with persons\\n who had adorned every one theirfore-part against their house with something of variety andsingular excellency\\n to entertain him withal as he passed inthe streets\\n they also themselves\\n as Emmanuel passed by\\n didwelcome him with shouts and acclamations of joy\\n saying\\n\\'Blessed be the Prince that cometh in the name of his FatherShaddai\\n\\'Fifthly\\n  At the castle gates the elders of Mansoul\\n namely\\nthe Lord Mayor\\n the Lord Willbewill\\n the subordinatepreacher\\n Mr\\n Knowledge\\n and Mr\\n Mind\\n with other of thegentry of the place\\n saluted Emmanuel again\\n  They bowedbefore him\\n they kissed the dust of his feet\\n they thanked\\nthey blessed\\n and praised his Highness for not takingadvantage against them for their sins\\n but rather had pityupon them in their misery\\n and returned to them with mercies\\nand to build up their Mansoul for ever\\n  Thus was he had upstraightway to the castle\\n for that was the royal palace\\n andthe place where his honour was to dwell\\n the which was readyprepared for his Highness by the presence of the LordSecretary\\n and the work of Captain Credence\\n  So he enteredin\\nSixthly\\n  Then the people and commonalty of the town ofMansoul came to him into the castle to mourn\\n and to weep\\nand to lament for their wickedness\\n by which they had forcedhim out of the town\\n  So when they were come\\n bowedthemselves to the ground seven times\\n they also wept\\n theywept aloud\\n and asked forgiveness of the Prince\\n and prayedthat he would again\\n as of old\\n confirm his love to Mansoul\\nTo the which the great Prince replied\\n \\'Weep not\\n but go yourway\\n eat the fat\\n and drink the sweet\\n and send portions tothem for whom nought is prepared\\n for the joy of your Lord isyour strength\\n  I am returned to Mansoul with mercies\\n and myname shall be set up\\n exalted\\n and magnified by it\\n\\'  He alsotook these inhabitants\\n and kissed them\\n and laid them in hisbosom\\nMoreover\\n he gave to the elders of Mansoul\\n and to each townofficer\\n a chain of gold and a signet\\n  He also sent to theirwives earrings and jewels\\n and bracelets\\n and other things\\nHe also bestowed upon the true-born children of Mansoul manyprecious things\\nWhen Emmanuel\\n the Prince\\n had done all these things for thefamous town of Mansoul\\n then he said unto them\\n first\\n \\'Washyour garments\\n then put on your ornaments\\n and then come tome into the castle of Mansoul\\n\\'  So they went to the fountainthat was set open for Judah and Jerusalem to wash in\\n andthere they washed\\n and there they made their \\'garmentswhite\\n\\' and came again to the Prince into the castle\\n andthus they stood before him\\nAnd now there was music and dancing throughout the whole townof Mansoul\\n and that because their Prince had again grantedto them his presence and the light of his countenance\\n thebells also did ring\\n and the sun shone comfortably upon themfor a great while together\\nThe town of Mansoul did also now more thoroughly seek thedestruction and ruin of all remaining Diabolonians that abodein the walls\\n and the dens that they had in the town ofMansoul\\n for there was of them that had\\n to this day\\n escapedwith life and limb from the hand of their suppressors in thefamous town of Mansoul\\nBut my Lord Willbewill was a greater terror to them now thanever he had been before\\n forasmuch as his heart was yet morefully bent to seek\\n contrive\\n and pursue them to the death\\nhe pursued them night and day\\n and did put them now to soredistress\\n as will afterwards appear\\nAfter things were thus far put into order in the famous townof Mansoul\\n care was taken\\n and order given by the blessedPrince Emmanuel\\n that the townsmen should\\n without furtherdelay\\n appoint some to go forth into the plain to bury thedead that were there\\n - the dead that fell by the sword ofEmmanuel\\n and by the shield of the Captain Credence\\n - lestthe fumes and ill savours that would arise from them mightinfect the air\\n and so annoy the famous town of Mansoul\\nThis also was a reason of this order\\n namely\\n that\\n as muchas in Mansoul lay\\n they might cut off the name\\n and being\\nand remembrance of those enemies from the thought of thefamous town of Mansoul and its inhabitants\\nSo order was given out by the Lord Mayor\\n that wise andtrusty friend of the town of Mansoul\\n that persons should beemployed about this necessary business\\n and Mr\\n Godly-Fear\\nand one Mr\\n Upright\\n were to be overseers about this matter\\nso persons were put under them to work in the fields\\n and tobury the slain that lay dead in the plains\\n  And these weretheir places of employment\\n some were to make the graves\\nsome to bury the dead\\n and some were to go to and fro in theplains\\n and also round about the borders of Mansoul\\n to seeif a skull\\n or a bone\\n or a piece of a bone of a doubter\\n wasyet to be found above ground anywhere near the corporation\\nand if any were found\\n it was ordered\\n that the searchersthat searched should set up a mark thereby\\n and a sign\\n thatthose that were appointed to bury them might find it\\n andbury it out of sight\\n that the name and remembrance of aDiabolonian doubter might be blotted out from under heaven\\nand that the children\\n and they that were to be born inMansoul\\n might not know\\n if possible\\n what a skull\\n what abone\\n or a piece of a bone of a doubter was\\n  So the buriers\\nand those that were appointed for that purpose\\n did as theywere commanded\\n they buried the doubters\\n and all the skullsand bones\\n and pieces of bones of doubters\\n wherever theyfound them\\n and so they cleansed the plains\\n  Now also Mr\\nGod\\'s-Peace took up his commission\\n and acted again as informer days\\nThus they buried in the plains about Mansoul the electiondoubters\\n the vocation doubters\\n the grace doubters\\n theperseverance doubters\\n the resurrection doubters\\n thesalvation doubters\\n and the glory doubters\\n whose captainswere Captain Rage\\n Captain Cruel\\n Captain Damnation\\n CaptainInsatiable\\n Captain Brimstone\\n Captain Torment\\n Captain No-Ease\\n Captain Sepulchre\\n and Captain Past-Hope\\n and oldIncredulity was\\n under Diabolus\\n their general\\n  There werealso the seven heads of their army\\n and they were the LordBeelzebub\\n the Lord Lucifer\\n the Lord Legion\\n the LordApollyon\\n the Lord Python\\n the Lord Cerberus\\n and the LordBelial\\n  But the princes and the captains\\n with oldIncredulity\\n their general\\n did all of them make theirescape\\n so their men fell down slain by the power of thePrince\\'s forces\\n and by the hands of the men of the town ofMansoul\\n  They also were buried as is afore related\\n to theexceeding great joy of the now famous town of Mansoul\\n  Theythat buried them buried also with them their arms\\n which werecruel instruments of death\\n (their weapons were arrows\\ndarts\\n mauls\\n firebrands\\n and the like)\\n  They buried alsotheir armour\\n their colours\\n banners\\n with the standard ofDiabolus\\n and what else soever they could find that did butsmell of a Diabolonian doubter\\nNow when the tyrant had arrived at Hell-Gate Hill\\n with hisold friend Incredulity\\n they immediately descended the den\\nand having there with their fellows for a while condoledtheir misfortune and great loss that they sustained againstthe town of Mansoul\\n they fell at length into a passion\\n andrevenged they would be for the loss that they sustainedbefore the town of Mansoul\\n  Wherefore they presently call acouncil to contrive yet further what was to be done againstthe famous town of Mansoul\\n for their yawning paunches couldnot wait to see the result of their Lord Lucifer\\'s and theirLord Apollyon\\'s counsel that they had given before\\n for theirraging gorge thought every day\\n even as long as a short forever\\n until they were filled with the body and soul\\n with theflesh and bones\\n and with all the delicates of Mansoul\\n  Theytherefore resolve to make another attempt upon the town ofMansoul\\n and that by an army mixed and made up partly ofdoubters\\n and partly of blood-men\\n  A more particular accountnow take of both\\nThe doubters are such as have their name from their nature\\nas well as from the land and kingdom where they are born\\ntheir nature is to put a question upon every one of thetruths of Emmanuel\\n and their country is called the land ofDoubting\\n and that land lieth off\\n and farthest remote to thenorth\\n between the land of Darkness and that called the\\'valley of the shadow of death\\n\\'  For though the land ofDarkness\\n and that called \\'the valley of the shadow ofdeath\\n\\' be sometimes called as if they were one and the self-same place\\n yet indeed they are two\\n lying but a little wayasunder\\n and the land of Doubting points in\\n and liethbetween them\\n  This is the land of Doubting\\n and these thatcame with Diabolus to ruin the town of Mansoul are thenatives of that country\\nThe blood-men are a people that have their name derived fromthe malignity of their nature\\n and from the fury that is inthem to execute it upon the town of Mansoul\\n their land liethunder the dog-star\\n and by that they are governed as to theirintellectuals\\n  The name of their country is the province ofLoath-good\\n the remote parts of it are far distant from theland of Doubting\\n yet they do both butt and bound upon thehill called Hell-Gate Hill\\n  These people are always inleague with the doubters\\n for they jointly do make questionof the faith and fidelity of the men of the town of Mansoul\\nand so are both alike qualified for the service of theirprince\\nNow of these two countries did Diabolus\\n by the beating ofhis drum\\n raise another army against the town of Mansoul\\n offive-and-twenty thousand strong\\n  There were ten thousanddoubters\\n and fifteen thousand blood-men\\n and they were putunder several captains for the war\\n and old Incredulity wasagain made general of the army\\nAs for the doubters\\n their captains were five of the seventhat were heads of the last Diabolonian army\\n and these aretheir names\\n Captain Beelzebub\\n Captain Lucifer\\n CaptainApollyon\\n Captain Legion\\n and Captain Cerberus\\n and thecaptains that they had before were some of them madelieutenants\\n and some ensigns of the army\\nBut Diabolus did not count that\\n in this expedition of his\\nthese doubters would prove his principal men\\n for theirmanhood had been tried before\\n also the Mansoulians had putthem to the worst\\n only he did bring them to multiply anumber\\n and to help\\n if need was\\n at a pinch\\n  But his trusthe put in his blood-men\\n for that they were all ruggedvillains\\n and he knew that they had done feats heretofore\\nAs for the blood-men\\n they also were under command and thenames of their captains were\\n Captain Cain\\n Captain Nimrod\\nCaptain Ishmael\\n Captain Esau\\n Captain Saul\\n Captain Absalom\\nCaptain Judas\\n and Captain Pope\\n1\\n Captain Cain was over two bands\\n namely\\n the zealous andthe angry blood-men\\n his standard-bearer bare the redcolours\\n and his scutcheon was the murdering club\\n2\\n Captain Nimrod was captain over two bands\\n namely\\n thetyrannical and encroaching blood-men\\n his standard-bearerbare the red colours\\n and his scutcheon was the greatbloodhound\\n3\\n Captain Ishmael was captain over two bands\\n namely\\n themocking and scorning blood-men\\n his standard-bearer bare thered colours\\n and his scutcheon was one mocking at Abraham\\'sIsaac\\n4\\n Captain Esau was captain over two bands\\n namely\\n theblood-men that grudged that another should have the blessing\\nalso over the blood-men that are for executing their privaterevenge upon others\\n his standard-bearer bare the redcolours\\n and his scutcheon was one privately lurking tomurder Jacob\\n5\\n Captain Saul was captain over two bands\\n namely\\n thegroundlessly jealous and the devilishly furious blood-men\\nhis standard-bearer bare the red colours\\n and his scutcheonwas three bloody darts cast at harmless David\\n6\\n Captain Absalom was captain over two bands\\n namely\\n overthe blood-men that will kill a father or a friend for theglory of this world\\n also over those blood-men that will holdone fair in hand with words\\n till they shall have pierced himwith their swords\\n his standard-bearer did bear the redcolours\\n and his scutcheon was the son pursuing the father\\'sblood\\n7\\n Captain Judas was over two bands\\n namely\\n the blood-menthat will sell a man\\'s life for money\\n and those also thatwill betray their friend with a kiss\\n his standard-bearerbare the red colours\\n and his scutcheon was thirty pieces ofsilver and the halter\\n8\\n Captain Pope was captain over one band\\n for all thesespirits are joined in one under him\\n his standard-bearer barethe red colours\\n and his scutcheon was the stake\\n the flame\\nand the good man in it\\nNow\\n the reason why Diabolus did so soon rally another force\\nafter he had been beaten out of the field\\n was\\n for that heput mighty confidence in this army of blood-men\\n for he put agreat deal of more trust in them than he did before in hisarmy of doubters\\n though they had also often done greatservice for him in the strengthening of him in his kingdom\\nBut these blood-men\\n he had proved them often\\n and theirsword did seldom return empty\\n  Besides\\n he knew that these\\nlike mastiffs\\n would fasten upon any\\n upon father\\n mother\\nbrother\\n sister\\n prince\\n or governor\\n yea upon the Prince ofprinces\\n  And that which encouraged him the more was\\n forthat they once did force Emmanuel out of the kingdom ofUniverse\\n \\'And why\\n\\' thought he\\n \\'may they not also drive himfrom the town of Mansoul\\n\\'So this army of five-and-twenty thousand strong was\\n by theirgeneral\\n the great Lord Incredulity\\n led up against the townof Mansoul\\n  Now Mr\\n Prywell\\n the scoutmaster-general\\n didhimself go out to spy\\n and he did bring Mansoul tidings oftheir coming\\n  Wherefore they shut up their gates\\n and putthemselves in a posture of defence against these newDiabolonians that came up against the town\\nSo Diabolus brought up his army\\n and beleaguered the town ofMansoul\\n the doubters were placed about Feel-gate\\n and theblood-men set down before Eye-gate and Ear-gate\\nNow when this army had thus encamped themselves\\n Incredulitydid\\n in the name of Diabolus\\n his own name\\n and in the nameof the blood-men and the rest that were with him\\n send asummons as hot as a red-hot iron to Mansoul\\n to yield totheir demands\\n threatening\\n that if they still stood it outagainst them\\n they would presently burn down Mansoul withfire\\n  For you must know that\\n as for the blood-men\\n theywere not so much that Mansoul should be surrendered\\n as thatMansoul should be destroyed\\n and cut off out of the land ofthe living\\n  True\\n they send to them to surrender\\n but shouldthey so do\\n that would not stench or quench the thirsts ofthese men\\n  They must have blood\\n the blood of Mansoul\\n elsethey die\\n and it is from hence that they have their name\\nWherefore these blood-men he reserved while now that theymight\\n when all his engines proved ineffectual\\n as his lastand sure card be played against the town of Mansoul\\nNow\\n when the townsmen had received this red-hot summons\\n itbegat in them at present some changing and interchangingthoughts\\n but they jointly agreed\\n in less than half an hour\\nto carry the summons to the Prince\\n the which they did whenthey had writ at the bottom of it\\n \\'Lord\\n save Mansoul frombloody men\\n\\'So he took it\\n and looked upon it\\n and considered it\\n andtook notice also of that short petition that the men ofMansoul had written at the bottom of it\\n and called to himthe noble Captain Credence\\n and bid him go and take CaptainPatience with him\\n and go and take care of that side ofMansoul that was beleaguered by the blood-men\\n  So they wentand did as they were commanded\\n the Captain Credence went andtook Captain Patience\\n and they both secured that side ofMansoul that was besieged by the blood-men\\nThen he commanded that Captain Good-hope and Captain Charity\\nand my Lord Willbewill\\n should take charge of the other sideof the town\\n  \\'And I\\n\\' said the Prince\\n \\'will set my standardupon the battlements of your castle\\n and do you three watchagainst the doubters\\n\\'  This done\\n he again commanded thatthe brave captain\\n the Captain Experience\\n should draw up hismen in the market-place\\n and that there he should exercisethem day by day before the people of the town of Mansoul\\nNow this siege was long\\n and many a fierce attempt did theenemy\\n especially those called the blood-men\\n make upon thetown of Mansoul\\n and many a shrewd brush did some of thetownsmen meet with from them\\n especially Captain Self-Denial\\nwho\\n I should have told you before\\n was commanded to take thecare of Ear-gate and Eye-gate now against the blood-men\\nThis Captain Self-Denial was a young man\\n but stout\\n and atownsman in Mansoul\\n as Captain Experience also was\\n  AndEmmanuel\\n at his second return to Mansoul\\n made him a captainover a thousand of the Mansoulians\\n for the good of thecorporation\\n  This captain\\n therefore\\n being an hardy man\\nand a man of great courage\\n and willing to venture himselffor the good of the town of Mansoul\\n would now and then sallyout upon the blood-men\\n and give them many notable alarms\\nand entered several brisk skirmishes with them\\n and also didsome execution upon them\\n but you must think that this couldnot easily be done\\n but he must meet with brushes himself\\nfor he carried several of their marks in his face\\n yea\\n andsome in some other parts of his body\\nSo\\n after some time spent for the trial of the faith\\n andhope\\n and love of the town of Mansoul\\n the Prince Emmanuelupon a day calls his captains and men of war together\\n anddivides them into two companies\\n this done\\n he commands themat a time appointed\\n and that in the morning very early\\n tosally out upon the enemy\\n saying\\n \\'Let half of you fall uponthe doubters\\n and half of you fall upon the blood-men\\n  Thoseof you that go out against the doubters\\n kill and slay\\n andcause to perish so many of them as by any means you can layhands on\\n but for you that go out against the blood-men\\n slaythem not\\n but take them alive\\n\\'So\\n at the time appointed\\n betimes in the morning\\n thecaptains went out as they were commanded\\n against theenemies\\n  Captain Good-Hope\\n Captain Charity\\n and those thatwere joined with them\\n as Captain Innocent and CaptainExperience\\n went out against the doubters\\n and CaptainCredence\\n and Captain Patience\\n with Captain Self-Denial\\n andthe rest that were to join with them\\n went out against theblood-men\\nNow\\n those that went out against the doubters drew up into abody before the plain\\n and marched on to bid them battle\\nBut the doubters\\n remembering their last success\\n made aretreat\\n not daring to stand the shock\\n but fled from thePrince\\'s men\\n wherefore they pursued them\\n and in theirpursuit slew many\\n but they could not catch them all\\n  Nowthose that escaped went some of them home\\n and the rest byfives\\n nines\\n and seventeens\\n like wanderers\\n went stragglingup and down the country\\n where they upon the barbarous peopleshowed and exercised many of their Diabolonian actions\\n nordid these people rise up in arms against them\\n but sufferedthemselves to be enslaved by them\\n  They would also afterthis show themselves in companies before the town of Mansoul\\nbut never to abide in it\\n for if Captain Credence\\n CaptainGood-Hope\\n or Captain Experience did but show themselves\\nthey fled\\nThose that went out against the blood-men did as they werecommanded\\n they forbore to slay any\\n but sought to compassthem about\\n  But the blood-men\\n when they saw that noEmmanuel was in the field\\n concluded also that no Emmanuelwas in Mansoul\\n wherefore they\\n looking upon what thecaptains did to be\\n as they called it\\n a fruit of theextravagancy of their wild and foolish fancies\\n ratherdespised them than feared them\\n  But the captains\\n mindingtheir business\\n at last did compass them round\\n they alsothat had routed the doubters came in amain to their aid\\n so\\nin fine\\n after some little struggling\\n (for the blood-menalso would have run for it\\n only now it was too late\\n forthough they are mischievous and cruel\\n where they canovercome\\n yet all blood-men are chicken-hearted men\\n whenthey once come to see themselves matched and equalled\\n) - sothe captains took them\\n and brought them to the Prince\\nNow when they were taken\\n had before the Prince\\n andexamined\\n he found them to be of three several counties\\nthough they all came out of one land\\n1\\n One sort of them came out of Blind-man-shire\\n and theywere such as did ignorantly what they did\\n2\\n Another sort of them came out of Blind-zeal-shire\\n andthey did superstitiously what they did\\n3\\n The third sort of them came out of the town of Malice\\n inthe county of Envy\\n and they did what they did out of spiteand implacableness\\nFor the first of these\\n namely\\n they that came out of Blind-man-shire\\n when they saw where they were\\n and against whomthey had fought\\n they trembled and cried\\n as they stoodbefore him\\n and as many of these as asked him mercy\\n hetouched their lips with his golden sceptre\\nThey that came out of Blind-zeal-shire\\n they did not as theirfellows did\\n for they pleaded that they had a right to dowhat they did\\n because Mansoul was a town whose laws andcustoms were diverse from all that dwelt thereabouts\\n  Veryfew of these could be brought to see their evil\\n but thosethat did\\n and asked mercy\\n they also obtained favour\\nNow\\n they that came out of the town of Malice\\n that is in thecounty of Envy\\n they neither wept\\n nor disputed\\n norrepented\\n but stood gnawing their tongues before him foranguish and madness\\n because they could not have their willupon Mansoul\\n  Now these last\\n with all those of the othertwo sorts that did not unfeignedly ask pardon for theirfaults\\n - those he made to enter into sufficient bond toanswer for what they had done against Mansoul\\n and againsther King\\n at the great and general assizes to be holden forour Lord the King\\n where he himself should appoint for thecountry and kingdom of Universe\\n  So they became bound eachman for himself\\n to come in\\n when called upon\\n to answerbefore our Lord the King for what they had done as before\\nAnd thus much concerning this second army that was sent byDiabolus to overthrow Mansoul\\nBut there were three of those that came from the land ofDoubting\\n who\\n after they had wandered and ranged the countrya while\\n and perceived that they had escaped\\n were so hardyas to thrust themselves\\n knowing that yet there were in thetown Diabolonians\\n - I say\\n they were so hardy as to thrustthemselves into Mansoul among them\\n  (Three\\n did I say\\n  Ithink there were four\\n)  Now\\n to whose house should theseDiabolonian doubters go\\n but to the house of an oldDiabolonian in Mansoul\\n whose name was Evil-Questioning\\n avery great enemy he was to Mansoul\\n and a great doer amongthe Diabolonians there\\n  Well\\n to this Evil-Questioning\\'shouse\\n as was said\\n did these Diabolonians come (you may besure that they had directions how to find the way thither)\\nso he made them welcome\\n pitied their misfortune\\n andsuccoured them with the best that he had in his house\\n  Now\\nafter a little acquaintance (and it was not long before theyhad that)\\n this old Evil-Questioning asked the doubters ifthey were all of a town (he knew that they were all of onekingdom)\\n and they answered\\n \\'No\\n nor not of one shireneither\\n for I\\n\\' said one\\n \\'am an election doubter\\n\\'  \\'I\\n\\'said another\\n \\'am a vocation doubter\\n\\' then said the third\\n\\'I am a salvation doubter\\n\\' and the fourth said he was agrace doubter\\n  \\'Well\\n\\' quoth the old gentleman\\n \\'be of whatshire you will\\n I am persuaded that you are down\\n boys\\n youhave the very length of my foot\\n are one with my heart\\n andshall be welcome to me\\n\\'  So they thanked him\\n and were gladthat they had found themselves an harbour in Mansoul\\nThen said Evil-Questioning to them\\n \\'How many of your companymight there be that came with you to the siege of Mansoul\\n\\'and they answered\\n \\'There were but ten thousand doubters inall\\n for the rest of the army consisted of fifteen thousandblood-men\\n  These blood-men\\n\\' quoth they\\n \\'border upon ourcountry\\n but\\n poor men\\n as we hear\\n they were every one takenby Emmanuel\\'s forces\\n\\'  \\'Ten thousand\\n\\' quoth the oldgentleman\\n \\'I will promise you\\n that is a round company\\n  Buthow came it to pass\\n since you were so mighty a number\\n thatyou fainted\\n and durst not fight your foes\\n\\'  \\'Our general\\n\\'said they\\n \\'was the first man that did run for it\\n\\'  \\'Pray\\n\\'quoth their landlord\\n \\'who was that\\n your cowardly general\\n\\'\\'He was once the Lord Mayor of Mansoul\\n\\' said they\\n \\'but praycall him not a cowardly general\\n for whether any from theeast to the west has done more service for our princeDiabolus\\n than has my Lord Incredulity\\n will be a hardquestion for you to answer\\n  But had they catched him\\n theywould for certain have hanged him\\n and we promise you\\nhanging is but a bad business\\n\\'  Then said the old gentleman\\n\\'I would that all the ten thousand doubters were now wellarmed in Mansoul\\n and myself at the head of them\\n I would seewhat I could do\\n\\'  \\'Ay\\n\\' said they\\n \\'that would be well if wecould see that\\n but wishes\\n alas\\n what are they\\n\\' and thesewords were spoken aloud\\n  \\'Well\\n\\' said old Evil-Questioning\\n\\'take heed that you talk not too loud\\n you must be quat andclose\\n and must take care of yourselves while you are here\\nor\\n I will assure you\\n you will be snapped\\n\\'  \\'Why\\n\\' quoththe doubters\\n  \\'Why\\n\\' quoth the old gentleman\\n \\'why\\n becauseboth the Prince and Lord Secretary\\n and their captains andsoldiers\\n are all at present in town\\n yea\\n the town is asfull of them as ever it can hold\\n  And besides\\n there is onewhose name is Willbewill\\n a most cruel enemy of ours\\n and himthe Prince has made keeper of the gates\\n and has commandedhim that\\n with all the diligence he can\\n he should look for\\nsearch out\\n and destroy all\\n and all manner of Diabolonians\\nAnd if he lighteth upon you\\n down you go\\n though your headswere made of gold\\n\\'And now\\n to see how it happened\\n one of the Lord Willbewill\\'sfaithful soldiers\\n whose name was Mr\\n Diligence\\n stood allthis while listening under old Evil-Questioning\\'s eaves\\n andheard all the talk that had been betwixt him and the doubtersthat he entertained under his roof\\nThe soldier was a man that my lord had much confidence in\\nand that he loved dearly\\n and that both because he was a manof courage\\n and also a man that was unwearied in seekingafter Diabolonians to apprehend them\\nNow this man\\n as I told you\\n heard all the talk that wasbetween old Evil-Questioning and these Diabolonians\\nwherefore what does he but goes to his lord\\n and tells himwhat he had heard\\n  \\'And sayest thou so\\n my trusty\\n\\' quoth mylord\\n  \\'Ay\\n\\' quoth Diligence\\n \\'that I do\\n and if yourlordship will be pleased to go with me\\n you shall find it asI have said\\n\\'  \\'And are they there\\n\\' quoth my lord\\n  \\'I knowEvil-Questioning well\\n for he and I were great in the time ofour apostasy\\n but I know not now where he dwells\\n\\'  \\'But Ido\\n\\' said his man\\n \\'and if your lordship will go\\n I will leadyou the way to his den\\n\\'  \\'Go\\n\\' quoth my lord\\n \\'that I will\\nCome\\n my Diligence\\n let us go find them out\\n\\'So my lord and his man went together the direct way to hishouse\\n  Now his man went before to show him his way\\n and theywent till they came even under old Mr\\n Evil-Questioning\\'swall\\n  Then said Diligence\\n \\'Hark\\n my lord\\n do you know theold gentleman\\'s tongue when you hear it\\n\\'  \\'Yes\\n\\' said mylord\\n \\'I know it well\\n but I have not seen him many a day\\nThis I know\\n he is cunning\\n I wish he doth not give us theslip\\n\\'  \\'Let me alone for that\\n\\' said his servant Diligence\\n\\'But how shall we find the door\\n\\' quoth my lord\\n  \\'Let mealone for that\\n too\\n\\' said his man\\n  So he had my LordWillbewill about\\n and showed him the way to the door\\n  Thenmy lord\\n without more ado\\n broke open the door\\n rushed intothe house\\n and caught them all five together\\n even asDiligence his man had told him\\n  So my lord apprehended them\\nand led them away\\n and committed them to the hand of Mr\\nTrueman\\n the gaoler\\n and commanded\\n and he did put them inward\\n  This done\\n my Lord Mayor was acquainted in the morningwith what my Lord Willbewill had done over night\\n and hislordship rejoiced much at the news\\n not only because therewere doubters apprehended\\n but because that old Evil-Questioning was taken\\n for he had been a very great troubleto Mansoul\\n and much affliction to my Lord Mayor himself\\n  Hehad also been sought for often\\n but no hand could ever belaid upon him till now\\nWell\\n the next thing was to make preparation to try thesefive that by my lord had been apprehended\\n and that were inthe hands of Mr\\n Trueman\\n the gaoler\\n  So the day was set\\nand the court called and come together\\n and the prisonersbrought to the bar\\n  My Lord Willbewill had power to haveslain them when at first he took them\\n and that without anymore ado\\n but he thought it at this time more for the honourof the Prince\\n the comfort of Mansoul\\n and the discouragementof the enemy\\n to bring them forth to public judgment\\nBut\\n I say\\n Mr\\n Trueman brought them in chains to the bar\\n tothe town-hall\\n for that was the place of judgment\\n  So\\n to beshort\\n the jury was panelled\\n the witnesses sworn\\n and theprisoners tried for their lives\\n the jury was the same thattried Mr\\n No-Truth\\n Pitiless\\n Haughty\\n and the rest of theircompanions\\nAnd\\n first\\n old Questioning himself was set to the bar for hewas the receiver\\n the entertainer\\n and comforter of thesedoubters\\n that by nation were outlandish men\\n then he was bidto hearken to his charge\\n and was told that he had liberty toobject\\n if he had ought to say for himself\\n  So hisindictment was read\\n the manner and form here follows\\n\\'Mr\\n Questioning\\n Thou art here indicted by the name of Evil-Questioning\\n an intruder upon the town of Mansoul\\n for thatthou art a Diabolonian by nature\\n and also a hater of thePrince Emmanuel\\n and one that hast studied the ruin of thetown of Mansoul\\n  Thou art also here indicted forcountenancing the King\\'s enemies\\n after wholesome laws madeto the contrary\\n for\\n 1\\n Thou hast questioned the truth ofher doctrine and state\\n 2\\n In wishing that ten thousanddoubters were in her\\n 3\\n In receiving\\n in entertaining\\n andencouraging of her enemies\\n that came from their army untothee\\n  What sayest thou to this indictment\\n art thou guiltyor not guilty\\n\\'\\'My lord\\n\\' quoth he\\n \\'I know not the meaning of thisindictment\\n forasmuch as I am not the man concerned in it\\nthe man that standeth by this charge accused before thisbench is called by the name of Evil-Questioning\\n which name Ideny to be mine\\n mine being Honest-Inquiry\\n  The one indeedsounds like the other\\n but\\n I trow\\n your lordships know thatbetween these two there is a wide difference\\n for I hope thata man\\n even in the worst of times\\n and that\\n too\\n amongst theworst of men\\n may make an honest inquiry after things\\nwithout running the danger of death\\n\\'Then spake my Lord Willbewill\\n for he was one of thewitnesses\\n \\'My lord\\n and you the honourable bench andmagistrates of the town of Mansoul\\n you all have heard withyour ears that the prisoner at the bar has denied his name\\nand so thinks to shift from the charge of the indictment\\nBut I know him to be the man concerned\\n and that his propername is Evil-Questioning\\n  I have known him\\n my lord\\n abovethese thirty years\\n for he and I (a shame it is for me tospeak it) were great acquaintance\\n when Diabolus\\n thattyrant\\n had the government of Mansoul\\n and I testify that heis a Diabolonian by nature\\n an enemy to our Prince\\n and ahater of the blessed town of Mansoul\\n  He has\\n in times ofrebellion\\n been at and lain in my house\\n my lord\\n not solittle as twenty nights together\\n and we did use to talkthen\\n for the substance of talk\\n as he and his doubters havetalked of late\\n true\\n I have not seen him many a day\\n  Isuppose that the coming of Emmanuel to Mansoul has made himchange his lodgings\\n as this indictment has driven him tochange his name\\n but this is the man\\n my lord\\n\\'Then said the court unto him\\n \\'Hast thou any more to say\\n\\'\\'Yes\\n\\' quoth the old gentleman\\n \\'that I have\\n for all that asyet has been said against me\\n is but by the mouth of onewitness\\n and it is not lawful for the famous town of Mansoul\\nat the mouth of one witness\\n to put any man to death\\n\\'Then stood forth Mr\\n Diligence\\n and said\\n \\'My lord\\n as I wasupon my watch such a night at the head of Bad Street\\n in thistown\\n I chanced to hear a muttering within this gentleman\\'shouse\\n  Then\\n thought I\\n what is to do here\\n  So I went upclose\\n but very softly\\n to the side of the house to listen\\nthinking\\n as indeed it fell out\\n that there I might lightupon some Diabolonian conventicle\\n  So\\n as I said\\n I drewnearer and nearer\\n and when I was got up close to the wall\\nit was but a while before I perceived that there wereoutlandish men in the house\\n but I did well understand theirspeech\\n for I have been a traveller myself\\n  Now\\n hearingsuch language in such a tottering cottage as this oldgentleman dwelt in\\n I clapped mine ear to a hole in thewindow\\n and there heard them talk as followeth\\n  This old Mr\\nQuestioning asked these doubters what they were\\n whence theycame\\n and what was their business in these parts\\n and theytold him to all these questions\\n yet he did entertain them\\nHe also asked what numbers there were of them\\n and they toldhim ten thousand men\\n  He then asked them\\n why they made nomore manly assault upon Mansoul\\n and they told him\\n so hecalled their general coward\\n for marching off when he shouldhave fought for his prince\\n  Further\\n this old Evil-Questioning wished\\n and I heard him wish\\n would all the tenthousand doubters were now in Mansoul\\n and himself at thehead of them\\n  He bid them also to take heed and lie quat\\nfor if they were taken they must die\\n although they had headsof gold\\n\\'  Then said the court\\n \\'Mr\\n Evil-Questioning\\n hereis now another witness against you\\n and his testimony isfull\\n 1\\n He swears that you did receive these men into yourhouse\\n and that you did nourish them there\\n though you knewthat they were Diabolonians\\n and the King\\'s enemies\\n  2\\n Heswears that you did wish ten thousand of them in Mansoul\\n  3\\nHe swears that you did give them advice to be quat and close\\nlest they were taken by the King\\'s servants\\n  All whichmanifesteth that thou art a Diabolonian\\n but hadst thou beena friend to the King\\n thou wouldst have apprehended them\\n\\'Then said Evil-Questioning\\n \\'To the first of these I answer\\nThe men that came into mine house were strangers\\n and I tookthem in\\n and is it now become a crime in Mansoul for a man toentertain strangers\\n  That I did also nourish them is true\\nand why should my charity be blamed\\n  As for the reason why Iwished ten thousand of them in Mansoul\\n I never told it tothe witnesses\\n nor to themselves\\n  I might wish them to betaken\\n and so my wish might mean well to Mansoul\\n for aughtthat any yet knows\\n  I did also bid them take heed that theyfell not into the captains\\' hands\\n but that might be becauseI am unwilling that any man should be slain\\n and not becauseI would have the King\\'s enemies as such escape\\n\\'My Lord Mayor then replied\\n \\'That though it was a virtue toentertain strangers\\n yet it was treason to entertain theKing\\'s enemies\\n  And for what else thou hast said\\n thou dostby words but labour to evade and defer the execution ofjudgment\\n  But could there be no more proved against thee butthat thou art a Diabolonian\\n thou must for that die the deathby the law\\n but to be a receiver\\n a nourisher\\n acountenancer\\n and a harbourer of others of them\\n yea\\n ofoutlandish Diabolonians\\n yea\\n of them that came from far onpurpose to cut off and destroy our Mansoul - this must not beborne\\n\\'Then said Evil-Questioning\\n \\'I see how the game will go\\n Imust die for my name\\n and for my charity\\n\\'  And so he heldhis peace\\nThen they called the outlandish doubters to the bar\\n and thefirst of them that was arraigned was the election doubter\\nSo his indictment was read\\n and because he was an outlandishman\\n the substance of it was told him by an interpreter\\nnamely\\n \\'That he was there charged with being an enemy ofEmmanuel the Prince\\n a hater of the town of Mansoul\\n and anopposer of her most wholesome doctrine\\n\\'Then the judge asked him if he would plead\\n but he said onlythis - That he confessed that he was an election doubter\\n andthat that was the religion that he had ever been brought upin\\n  And said\\n moreover\\n \\'If I must die for my religion\\n Itrow\\n I shall die a martyr\\n and so I care the less\\n\\'JUDGE\\n  Then it was replied\\n \\'To question election\\n is tooverthrow a great doctrine of the gospel\\n namely\\n theomnisciency\\n and power\\n and will of God\\n to take away theliberty of God with his creature\\n to stumble the faith of thetown of Mansoul\\n and to make salvation to depend upon works\\nand not upon grace\\n  It also belied the word\\n and disquietedthe minds of the men of Mansoul\\n therefore by the best oflaws he must die\\n\\'Then was the vocation doubter called\\n and set to the bar\\n andhis indictment for substance was the same with the other\\nonly he was particularly charged with denying the calling ofMansoul\\nThe judge asked him also what he had to say for himself\\nSo he replied\\n \\'That he never believed that there was anysuch thing as a distinct and powerful call of God to Mansoul\\notherwise than by the general voice of the word\\n nor by thatneither\\n otherwise than as it exhorted them to forbear evil\\nand to do that which is good\\n and in so doing a promise ofhappiness is annexed\\n\\'Then said the judge\\n \\'Thou art a Diabolonian\\n and hast denieda great part of one of the most experimental truths of thePrince of the town of Mansoul\\n for he has called\\n and she hasheard a most distinct and powerful call of her Emmanuel\\n bywhich she has been quickened\\n awakened\\n and possessed withheavenly grace to desire to have communion with her Prince\\nto serve him\\n and to do his will\\n and to look for herhappiness merely of his good pleasure\\n  And for thineabhorrence of this good doctrine\\n thou must die the death\\n\\'Then the grace doubter was called\\n and his indictment wasread and he replied thereto\\n \\'That though he was of the landof doubting\\n his father was the offspring of a Pharisee\\n andlived in good fashion among his neighbours\\n and that hetaught him to believe\\n and believe it I do\\n and will\\n thatMansoul shall never be saved freely by grace\\n\\'Then said the judge\\n \\'Why\\n the law of the Prince is plain\\n 1\\nNegatively\\n \"not of works\\n\" 2\\n Positively\\n \"by grace you aresaved\\n\"  And thy religion settleth in and upon the works ofthe flesh\\n for the works of the law are the works of theflesh\\n  Besides\\n in saying as thou hast done\\n thou hastrobbed God of His glory\\n and given it to a sinful man\\n thouhast robbed Christ of the necessity of His undertaking\\n andthe sufficiency thereof\\n and hast given both these to theworks of the flesh\\n  Thou hast despised the work of the HolyGhost\\n and hast magnified the will of the flesh\\n and of thelegal mind\\n  Thou art a Diabolonian\\n the son of aDiabolonian\\n and for thy Diabolonian principles thou mustdie\\n\\'The court then\\n having proceeded thus far with them\\n sent outthe jury\\n who forthwith brought them in guilty of death\\nThen stood up the Recorder\\n and addressed himself to theprisoners\\n \\'You\\n the prisoners at the bar\\n you have been hereindicted\\n and proved guilty of high crimes against Emmanuelour Prince\\n and against the welfare of the famous town ofMansoul\\n crimes for which you must be put to death\\n and dieye accordingly\\n\\'  So they were sentenced to the death of thecross\\n  The place assigned them for execution\\n was that whereDiabolus drew up his last army against Mansoul\\n save onlythat old Evil-Questioning was hanged at the top of BadStreet\\n just over against his own door\\nWhen the town of Mansoul had thus far rid themselves of theirenemies\\n and of the troublers of their peace\\n in the nextplace a strict commandment was given out\\n that yet my LordWillbewill should\\n with Diligence his man\\n search for\\n and dohis best to apprehend what town Diabolonians were yet leftalive in Mansoul\\n  The names of several of them were\\n Mr\\nFooling\\n Mr\\n Let-Good-Slip\\n Mr\\n Slavish-Fear\\n Mr\\n No-Love\\nMr\\n Mistrust\\n Mr\\n Flesh\\n and Mr\\n Sloth\\n  It was alsocommanded\\n that he should apprehend Mr\\n Evil-Questioning\\'schildren\\n that he left behind him\\n and that they shoulddemolish his house\\n  The children that he left behind himwere these\\n Mr\\n Doubt\\n and he was his eldest son\\n the next tohim was Legal-Life\\n Unbelief\\n Wrong-Thoughts-of-Christ\\n Clip-Promise\\n Carnal-Sense\\n Live-by-Feeling\\n Self-Love\\n  All thesehe had by one wife\\n and her name was No-Hope\\n she was thekinswoman of old Incredulity\\n for he was her uncle\\n and whenher father\\n old Dark\\n was dead\\n he took her and brought herup\\n and when she was marriageable\\n he gave her to this oldEvil-Questioning to wife\\nNow the Lord Willbewill did put into execution hiscommission\\n with great Diligence\\n his man\\n  He took Foolingin the streets\\n and hanged him up in Want-wit-Alley\\n overagainst his own house\\n  This Fooling was he that would havehad the town of Mansoul deliver up Captain Credence into thehands of Diabolus\\n provided that then he would have withdrawnhis force out of the town\\n  He also took Mr\\n Let-Good-Slipone day as he was busy in the market\\n and executed himaccording to law\\n  Now there was an honest poor man inMansoul\\n and his name was Mr\\n Meditation\\n one of no greataccount in the days of apostasy\\n but now of repute with thebest of the town\\n  This man\\n therefore\\n they were willing toprefer\\n  Now Mr\\n Let-Good-Slip had a great deal of wealthheretofore in Mansoul\\n and\\n at Emmanuel\\'s coming\\n it wassequestered to the use of the Prince\\n this\\n therefore\\n wasnow given to Mr\\n Meditation\\n to improve for the common good\\nand after him to his son\\n Mr\\n Think-Well\\n this Think-Well hehad by Mrs\\n Piety his wife\\n and she was the daughter of Mr\\nRecorder\\nAfter this\\n my lord apprehended Clip-Promise\\n now because hewas a notorious villain\\n for by his doings much of the King\\'scoin was abused\\n therefore he was made a public example\\n  Hewas arraigned and judged to be first set in the pillory\\n thento be whipped by all the children and servants in Mansoul\\nand then to be hanged till he was dead\\n  Some may wonder atthe severity of this man\\'s punishment\\n but those that arehonest traders in Mansoul\\n are sensible of the great abusethat one clipper of promises in little time may do to thetown of Mansoul\\n  And truly my judgment is\\n that all those ofhis name and life should be served even as he\\nHe also apprehended Carnal-Sense\\n and put him in hold\\n buthow it came about\\n I cannot tell\\n but he brake prison\\n andmade his escape\\n yea\\n and the bold villain will not yet quitthe town\\n but lurks in the Diabolonian dens a days\\n andhaunts like a ghost honest men\\'s houses a nights\\n  Wherefore\\nthere was a proclamation set up in the market-place inMansoul\\n signifying that whosoever could discover Carnal-Sense\\n and apprehend him and slay him\\n should be admitteddaily to the Prince\\'s table\\n and should be made keeper of thetreasure of Mansoul\\n  Many\\n therefore\\n did bend themselves todo this thing\\n but take him and slay him they could not\\nthough often he was discovered\\nBut my lord took Mr\\n Wrong-Thoughts-of-Christ\\n and put him inprison\\n and he died there\\n though it was long first\\n for hedied of a lingering consumption\\nSelf-Love was also taken and committed to custody\\n but therewere many that were allied to him in Mansoul\\n so his judgmentwas deferred\\n  But at last Mr\\n Self-Denial stood up\\n andsaid\\n \\'If such villains as these may be winked at in Mansoul\\nI will lay down my commission\\n\\'  He also took him from thecrowd\\n and had him among his soldiers\\n and there he wasbrained\\n  But some in Mansoul muttered at it\\n though nonedurst speak plainly\\n because Emmanuel was in town\\n  But thisbrave act of Captain Self-Denial came to the Prince\\'s ears\\nso he sent for him\\n and made him a lord in Mansoul\\n  My LordWillbewill also obtained great commendations of Emmanuel\\n forwhat he had done for the town of Mansoul\\nThen my Lord Self-Denial took courage\\n and set to thepursuing of the Diabolonians\\n with my Lord Willbewill\\n andthey took Live-by-Feeling\\n and they took Legal-Life\\n and putthem in hold till they died\\n  But Mr\\n Unbelief was a nimbleJack\\n him they could never lay hold of\\n though they attemptedto do it often\\n  He therefore\\n and some few more of thesubtlest of the Diabolonian tribe\\n did yet remain in Mansoul\\nto the time that Mansoul left off to dwell any longer in thekingdom of Universe\\n  But they kept them to their dens andholes\\n if one of them did appear\\n or happen to be seen in anyof the streets of the town of Mansoul\\n the whole town wouldbe up in arms after them\\n yea\\n the very children in Mansoulwould cry out after them as after a thief\\n and would wishthat they might stone them to death with stones\\n  And now didMansoul arrive to some good degree of peace and quiet\\n herPrince also did abide within her borders\\n her captains\\n also\\nand her soldiers did their duties\\n and Mansoul minded hertrade that she had with the country that was afar off\\n alsoshe was busy in her manufacture\\nWhen the town of Mansoul had thus far rid themselves of somany of their enemies\\n and the troublers of their peace\\n thePrince sent to them\\n and appointed a day wherein he would\\n atthe market-place\\n meet the whole people\\n and there give themin charge concerning some further matters\\n that\\n if observed\\nwould tend to their further safety and comfort\\n and to thecondemnation and destruction of their home-bred Diabolonians\\nSo the day appointed was come\\n and the townsmen met together\\nEmmanuel also came down in his chariot\\n and all his captainsin their state attending him\\n on the right hand and on theleft\\n  Then was an oyes made for silence\\n and\\n after somemutual carriages of love\\n the Prince began\\n and thusproceeded\\n-\\'You\\n my Mansoul\\n and the beloved of mine heart\\n many andgreat are the privileges that I have bestowed upon you\\n Ihave singled you out from others\\n and have chosen you tomyself\\n not for your worthiness\\n but for mine own sake\\n  Ihave also redeemed you\\n not only from the dread of myFather\\'s law\\n but from the hand of Diabolus\\n  This I havedone because I loved you\\n and because I have set my heartupon you to do you good\\n  I have also\\n that all things\\n thatmight hinder thy way to the pleasures of paradise might betaken out of the way\\n laid down for thee for thy soul aplenary satisfaction\\n and have bought thee to myself\\n a pricenot of corruptible things\\n as of silver and gold\\n but a priceof blood\\n mine own blood\\n which I have freely spilled uponthe ground to make thee mine\\n  So I have reconciled thee\\n Omy Mansoul\\n to my Father\\n and entrusted thee in the mansionhouses that are with my Father in the royal city\\n wherethings are\\n O my Mansoul\\n that eye hath not seen\\n nor hathentered into the heart of man to conceive\\n\\'Besides\\n O my Mansoul\\n thou seest what I have done\\n and howI have taken thee out of the hands of thine enemies\\n untowhom thou hadst deeply revolted from my Father\\n and by whomthou wast content to be possessed\\n and also to be destroyed\\nI came to thee first by my law\\n then by my gospel\\n to awakenthee\\n and show thee my glory\\n  And thou knowest what thouwast\\n what thou saidst\\n what thou didst\\n and how many timesthou rebelledst against

seest\\n also\\n what a company of my Father\\'s host I havelodged within thy borders\\n captains and rulers\\n soldiers andmen of war\\n engines and excellent devices to subdue and bringdown thy

forthy transgressions have hid my face\\n and withdrawn mypresence from thee\\n  The way of backsliding was thine\\n butthe way and means of thy recovery was mine\\n  I invented themeans of thy

andsalvation\\n  It was I that fetched the second time theDiabolonians out of Mansoul\\n and it was I that overcame them\\nand that destroyed them before thy face\\n\\'And now\\n my Mansoul\\n I am returned to thee in peace\\n and thytransgressions against me are as if they had not been\\n  Norshall it be with thee as in former days\\n but I will do betterfor thee than at thy beginning\\nFor yet a little while\\n O my Mansoul\\n even after a few moretimes are gone over thy head\\n I will (but be not thoutroubled at what I say) take down this famous town ofMansoul\\n stick and stone\\n to the ground\\n  And I will carrythe stones thereof\\n and the timber thereof\\n and the wallsthereof\\n and the dust thereof\\n and the inhabitants thereof\\ninto mine own country\\n even into a kingdom of my Father\\n andwill there set it up in such strength and glory\\n as it neverdid see in the kingdom where now it is placed\\n  I will eventhere set it up for my Father\\'s habitation\\n for for thatpurpose it was at first erected in the kingdom of Universe\\nand there will I make it a spectacle of wonder\\n a monument ofmercy\\n and the admirer of its own mercy\\n  There shall thenatives of Mansoul see all that\\n of which they have seennothing here\\n there shall they be equal to those unto whomthey have been inferior here\\n  And there shalt thou\\n O myMansoul\\n have such communion with me\\n with my Father\\n andwith your Lord Secretary\\n as it is not possible here to beenjoyed\\n nor ever could be\\n shouldest thou live in Universethe space of a thousand years\\n\\'And there\\n O my Mansoul\\n thou shalt be afraid of murderersno more\\n of Diabolonians\\n and their threats\\n no more\\n  There\\nthere shall be no more plots\\n nor contrivances\\n nor designsagainst thee\\n O my Mansoul\\n  There thou shalt no more hearthe evil-tidings\\n or the noise of the Diabolonian drum\\nThere thou shalt not see the Diabolonian standard-bearers\\nnor yet behold Diabolus\\'s standard\\n  No Diabolonian mountshall be cast up against thee there\\n nor shall there theDiabolonian standard be set up to make thee afraid\\n  Therethou shalt not need captains\\n engines\\n soldiers\\n and men ofwar\\n  There thou shalt meet with no sorrow\\n nor grief\\n norshall it be possible that any Diabolonian should again\\n forever\\n be able to creep into thy skirts\\n burrow in thy walls\\nor be seen again within thy borders all the days of eternity\\nLife shall there last longer than here you are able to desireit should\\n and yet it shall always be sweet and new\\n norshall any impediment attend it for ever\\n\\'There\\n O Mansoul\\n thou shalt meet with many of those thathave been like thee\\n and that have been partakers of thysorrows\\n even such as I have chosen\\n and redeemed\\n and setapart\\n as thou\\n for my Father\\'s court and city-royal\\n  Allthey will be glad in thee\\n and thou\\n when thou seest them\\nshalt be glad in thine heart\\n\\'There are things\\n O Mansoul\\n even things of my Father\\'sproviding\\n and mine\\n that never were seen since the beginningof the world\\n and they are laid up with my Father\\n and sealedup among his treasures for thee\\n till thou shalt come thitherto enjoy them\\n  I told you before\\n that I would remove myMansoul\\n and set it up elsewhere\\n and where I will set it\\nthere are those that love thee\\n and those that rejoice inthee now\\n but how much more\\n when they shall see thee exaltedto honour\\n  My Father will then send them for you to fetchyou\\n and their bosoms are chariots to put you in\\n  And you\\n Omy Mansoul\\n shall ride upon the wings of the wind\\n  They willcome to convey\\n conduct\\n and bring you to that\\n when youreyes see more\\n that will be your desired haven\\n\\'And thus\\n O my Mansoul\\n I have showed unto thee what shallbe done to thee hereafter\\n if thou canst hear\\n if thou canstunderstand\\n and now I will tell thee what at present must bethy duty and practice\\n until I come and fetch thee to myself\\naccording as is related in the Scriptures of truth\\n\\'First\\n I charge thee that thou dost hereafter keep morewhite and clean the liveries which I gave thee before my lastwithdrawing from thee\\n  Do it\\n I say\\n for this will be thywisdom\\n  They are in themselves fine linen\\n but thou mustkeep them white and clean\\n  This will be your wisdom\\n yourhonour\\n and will be greatly for my glory\\n  When your garmentsare white\\n the world will count you mine\\n  Also\\n when yourgarments are white\\n then I am delighted in your ways\\n forthen your goings to and fro will be like a flash oflightning\\n that those that are present must take notice of\\nalso their eyes will be made to dazzle thereat\\n  Deckthyself\\n therefore\\n according to my bidding\\n and make thyselfby my law straight steps for thy feet\\n so shall thy Kinggreatly desire thy beauty\\n for he is thy Lord\\n and worshipthou him\\n\\'Now\\n that thou mayest keep them as I bid thee\\n I have\\n as Ibefore did tell thee\\n provided for thee an open fountain towash thy garments in\\n  Look\\n therefore\\n that thou wash oftenin my fountain\\n and go not in defiled garments\\n for as it isto my dishonour and my disgrace\\n so it will be to thydiscomfort\\n when you shall walk in filthy garments\\n  Let not\\ntherefore\\n my garments\\n your garments\\n the garments that Igave thee\\n be defiled or spotted by the flesh\\n  Keep thygarments always white\\n and let thy head lack no ointment\\n\\'My Mansoul\\n I have ofttimes delivered thee from the designs\\nplots\\n attempts\\n and conspiracies of Diabolus\\n and for allthis I ask thee nothing\\n but that thou render not to me evilfor my good\\n but that thou bear in mind my love\\n and thecontinuation of my kindness to my beloved Mansoul\\n so as toprovoke thee to walk in thy measure according to the benefitbestowed on thee\\n  Of old\\n the sacrifices were bound withcoords to the horns of the altar\\n  Consider what is said tothee\\n O my blessed Mansoul\\n\\'O my Mansoul\\n I have lived\\n I have died\\n I live\\n and willdie no more for thee\\n  I live\\n that thou mayest not die\\nBecause I live\\n thou shalt live also\\n  I reconciled thee tomy Father by the blood of my cross\\n and being reconciled\\nthou shalt live through me\\n  I will pray for thee\\n I willfight for thee\\n I will yet do thee good\\n\\'Nothing can hurt thee but sin\\n nothing can grieve me butsin\\n nothing can make thee base before thy foes but sin\\n takeheed of sin\\n my Mansoul\\n\\'And dost thou know why I at first\\n and do still\\n sufferDiabolonians to dwell in thy walls\\n O Mansoul\\n  It is to keepthee wakening\\n to try thy love\\n to make thee watchful\\n and tocause thee yet to prize my noble captains\\n their soldiers\\nand my mercy\\n\\'It is also\\n that yet thou mayest be made to remember what adeplorable condition thou once wast in\\n  I mean when\\n notsome\\n but all did dwell\\n not in thy walls\\n but in thy castle\\nand in thy stronghold\\n O Mansoul\\n\\'O my Mansoul\\n should I slay all them within\\n many there bewithout\\n that would bring thee into bondage\\n for were allthese within cut off\\n those without would find thee sleeping\\nand then\\n as in a moment\\n they would swallow up my Mansoul\\nI therefore left them in thee\\n not to do thee hurt (the whichthey yet will\\n if thou hearken to them\\n and serve them\\n) butto do thee good\\n the which they must\\n if thou watch and fightagainst them\\n  Know\\n therefore\\n that whatever they shalltempt thee to\\n my design is\\n that they should drive thee\\n notfurther off\\n but nearer to my father\\n to learn thee war\\n tomake petitioning desirable to thee\\n and to make thee littlein thine own eyes\\n  Hearken diligently to this\\n my Mansoul\\n\\'Show me\\n then\\n thy love\\n my Mansoul\\n and let not those thatare within thy walls\\n take thy affections off from him thathath redeemed thy soul\\n  Yea\\n let the sight of a Diabolonianheighten thy love to me\\n  I came once\\n and twice\\n and thrice\\nto save thee from the poison of those arrows that would havewrought thy death\\n stand for me\\n thy Friend\\n my Mansoul\\nagainst the Diabolonians\\n and I will stand for thee before myFather\\n and all his court\\n  Love me against temptation\\n and Iwill love thee notwithstanding thine infirmities\\n\\'O my Mansoul\\n remember what my captains\\n my soldiers\\n andmine engines have done for thee\\n  They have fought for thee\\nthey have suffered by thee\\n they have borne much at thy handsto do thee good\\n O Mansoul\\n  Hadst thou not had them to helpthee\\n Diabolus had certainly made a hand of thee\\n  Nourishthem\\n therefore\\n my Mansoul\\n  When thou dost well\\n they willbe well\\n when thou dost ill\\n they will be ill\\n and sick\\n andweak\\n  Make not my captains sick\\n O Mansoul\\n for if they besick\\n thou canst not be well\\n if they be weak\\n thou canst notbe strong\\n if they be faint\\n thou canst not be stout andvaliant for thy King\\n O Mansoul\\n  Nor must thou think alwaysto live by sense\\n thou must live upon my word\\n  Thou mustbelieve\\n O my Mansoul\\n when I am from thee\\n that yet I lovethee\\n and bear thee upon mine heart for ever\\n\\'Remember\\n therefore\\n O my Mansoul\\n that thou art beloved ofme\\n as I have\\n therefore\\n taught thee to watch\\n to fight\\n topray\\n and to make war against my foes\\n so now I command theeto believe that my love is constant to thee\\n  O my Mansoul\\nhow have I set my heart\\n my love upon thee\\n  Watch\\n  Behold\\nI lay none other burden upon thee\\n than what thou
